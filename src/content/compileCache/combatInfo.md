First, foremost and most importantly, this app is _not meant_ to perfectly simulate combat in Qud. Instead, the purpose of this tool is to be able to easily do the following:

1. Stat out a build
2. Compare weapons between each other
3. Compare weapons between specific creatures
4. Compare kit rotations
5. Calculate TTK (Time To Kill)

If you've ever attempted to do any of the above, you will certainly have found out that there are a massive amount of variables to keep in mind to ensure a proper comparison, and the mathematics are tricky to keep correct even though they aren't extremely high level.

The biggest problem is factoring in the interaction between attacks and inflicted status effects; in these cases the mathematics are so difficult to work out they are often times ignored for simplicity. This is where statistical prediction falls short and simulation becomes more accurate.

The calculator works by simulating actions in a simplified but functionally identical way as the actual game. You set how many trials you're interested in simulating, and the calculator will do so. This data is aggregated and then displayed back to you in a way that is easier to consume and make decisions off of than tinkering around in the game with wishes.
