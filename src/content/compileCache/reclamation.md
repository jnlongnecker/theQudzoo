This quest interrupts the We Are Starfreight! quest as soon as you arrive at Ezra and needs to be completed in a single shot. If you leave without killing all 4 legendary Templar, the game will tell you that the Templar will regroup. The actual consequences are fairly minor; you just fail the quest and get a new one that's identical to it, including your progress through it. Barathrumites in any zones with an encounter in them are removed, but they don't help much anyway. There also doesn't seem to be a limit at how many "reattempts" you're allowed either, so don't worry too much about it.

## Surveying the Scene

When you arrive at Ezra, you will find that it is under attack by an enormous military force of Templars. There will be 4 legendary Templar that must be killed for the quest to completed, and partway into the attack a Girsh Nephilim will arrive in a random zone around the Spindle. There are around 2-3 zones with Templar forces in them without a legendary accompanying them that don't need to be killed for the quest to be completed, but why not clean the board of Templar?

There are actually 16 zones around the Spindle, which itself is an entire parasang. Make sure you circle the entire Spindle in order to discover all the forces brought by the Templar.

## Tackling the Templar

In total, there will be a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/VehicleTemplarMech3.png" /></span>temple</span> mecha mk II</span></span>, a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Grand Newfather.png" /></span>grand</span> newfather</span></span>, and 2 <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Knight Commander of the Holy Temple.png" /></span>Knight</span> Commander of the Holy Temple</span></span> that all are legendary to deal with. Each one will have additional forces supporting them, including <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Newfather.png" /></span>newfathers</span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Phylactery Squire.png" /></span>phylactery</span> squires</span></span> and mk I mechas. The forces each one has are random, so be prepared for anything. The Golem is more than capable of destroying all of the Templar forces on its own, but be sure to let it recover between fights as it is powerful but not immortal.

I won't make a mention of it in the individual combat sections, but keep in mind that the entire Spindle grounds are _outside_, which means if you have perfect <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandFlyToggle.png" /></span>Flight</span></span></span> (as is recommended), then you can use a ranged weapon to kill all melee combatants in perfect safety.

### The Knight Commanders

The two <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Knight Commander of the Holy Temple.png" /></span>Knight</span> Commander of the Holy Temple</span></span> are the same type of creature that led the raid in [A Call To Arms](./a-call-to-arms#knight-commander-of-the-holy-temple), and are hopefully much less dangerous to you at this point. To recap on their abilities, they will use <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Menacing Stare.png" /></span>Menacing</span> Stare</span></span> to fear you and have you lose control of your positioning and will try and lock you down with <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield Slam.png" /></span>Shield</span> Slam</span></span>. Disarm via <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dueling Stance.png" /></span>Dueling</span> Stance</span></span> + <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span>Lunge</span></span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Disarming Shot.png" /></span>Disarming</span> Shot</span></span> are extremely effective here and they can remove both the primary weapon of the knight commander _and_ the shield, removing the ability to <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield Slam.png" /></span>Shield</span> Slam</span></span>.

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Knight Commander of the Holy Temple.png" /></span>Knight</span> Commander of the Holy Temple</span></span> are often accompanied by temple mecha mk Is, of which the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/VehicleTemplarMech1.png" /></span>temple</span> mecha mk Ia</span></span> is the more threatening. The mk Ia is the melee variant and is extremely mobile and will use that mobility. Utilize the Golem to quickly focus and destroy any mk Ia mechas that appear. By this point in the game, you're likely to have extremely high <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span> and if not, your <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> will be plenty to withstand the weaponry of the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/VehicleTemplarMech2_Battle.png" /></span>temple</span> mecha mk Ib</span></span>.

### The Grand Newfather

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Grand Newfather.png" /></span>Grand</span> newfathers</span></span> are amongst the most dangerous of the Templar forces as they will have 2-4 creature slaves under their command of tier 7-8. These could be anything from <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/SoupSludgeSpawnerTier5.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="c">soupy</span></span></span> sludges</span></span> to <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Star Kraken.png" /></span>star</span> kraken</span></span>, so be prepared for virtually anything the game can throw at you. With command of the Golem, you should be more than capable of handling any of these creatures. Be careful for any creatures capable of instant death or stun locks; you'll want to disable them with freeze grenades, flashbang grenades, or other similar methods.

The <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Grand Newfather.png" /></span>grand</span> newfather</span></span> itself is much less of a threat, but still dangerous. They are melee combatants, so disarming them or keeping them at range handles them well, and if you are at the recommended <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> they will struggle to do any damage at all.

### The Temple Mecha mk II

This is definitely the most serious combatant of them all. It is lethal in both melee and long range, so there is minimal opportunity to cheese its power. The best option is definitely to utilize the power of the Golem to fight it on more even ground, and a full-power Golem is certainly capable of taking on the mecha. Important to note that the mk II, like other mechas, is vulnerable to EMP so be sure to keep a few just in case of emergencies.

The <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/VehicleTemplarMech3.png" /></span>temple</span> mecha mk II</span></span> has several unique abilities. To begin the combat, it will fire a barrage of missiles around it. These have a rather large radius and are explosives, meaning they will bypass <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span> and move terrain. A direct hit from one of these can easily rack up to over 100 damage, so be sure to avoid it. Even if you are outside of the alert markers from the missiles, you can still be damaged by the blast radius as it extends past the markers by a few tiles. It will continue to periodically fire missiles during the combat, so make sure you move enough to avoid them.

If you put too much distance between yourself and the mecha, not only will it just shoot at you the whole time, but it will also <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span>Jump</span></span></span> at you and boy does it have hops. This <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span>Jump</span></span></span> has a massive range on it (8 tiles or so) and will send out a stunning shockwave (mechanically similar to <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Stunning Force.png" /></span>Stunning</span> Force</span></span>) from itself when it lands, which can give it a few turns to rip into your <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span>. Unless you're being forced to move due to a missile, it's best to stay close to avoid this leap. Staying close doesn't mean you're safe, however. The mechanical hull of the mecha will attempt to crush you, and can easily hit 20+ damage in a single penetration.

While it's _possible_ that the supplementing forces around the mecha are weak, it is not guaranteed. You can easily get multiple mecha mk I supporting the mk II. Without a rather powerful build and good game knowledge, it is definitely recommended to utilize the power of the Golem in order to take down the mk II in particular. Even the Golem can quickly be shredded by the mk II with bad positioning, so it is also recommended that you pilot the Golem in order to make the most use out of its power and to keep yourself secure.

## The Girsh Nephilim

Partway through the quest, the world will quake and you will receive a popup letting you know that a Girsh Nephilim has arrived to the Spindle in a direction. This can be a zone you've explored before or one you haven't, so it very well may arrive somewhere with a legendary Templar on it. The trigger is either when all Templar leaders are killed or a certain number of turns have passed (random), which also depends on which attempt it is (the higher the attempt number, the higher the turn delay). The Nephilim that arrives will be one that you haven't killed before, so if you've killed any of the Nephilim (or pacified them), then they won't arrive here and you can narrow your options. However, if you kill or pacify all 6 naturally existing Nephilim, you will instead have to face the true superboss of Qud: Starformed <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span>.

The 6 naturally occurring Nephilim are the following:

- <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span>
- <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span>
- <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon</span></span></span>
- <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span>
- <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span>
- <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span>

Each one has 4,000 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span>, 60 in all resistances, and a special mutation called the Irisdual Beam, which is the primary gimmick of the Nephilim as a group. The Irisdual Beam is a special attack with a long cooldown that fires in 3 directions above 50% <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span> and 6 directions below 50% <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span>. There is 1 turn of windup for the beam before it fires, and at least 1 beam will target you directly. The beam does incredible damage if it connects and ignores <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span> and, to an extent, <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span>. The way the damage of the beam works is it has 7 damage types: Acid, Cold, Electric, Heat, Poison, Umbral and Cosmic. Umbral is the same damage type as <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span>Haggabah's</span></span></span> hands, and Cosmic is the same damage type as a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Chrome Pyramid.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="c">chrome</span> pyramid's</span></span></span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/ChromePyramid_SpacetimeDistortion.png" /></span>distortion</span> field</span></span> (melee attack). Umbral and Cosmic cannot be reduced in any way, but the other damage types absolutely can.

Each damage type can do 30 - 40 points of damage, and if you are hit by the beam you are hit by all 7 damage types simultaneously. If you have resistance to those damage types, you will take lower amounts of damage from the beam overall. However, as Umbral and Cosmic damage cannot be negated or reduced in any way, you will take damage from a minimum of 2 of the damage types. Poison damage can be negated only if you have <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SlogTrophy.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="g">S</span><span class="w">l</span><span class="w">o</span><span class="g">g</span><span class="g">'</span><span class="g">s</span><span class="w"></span> </span><span class="w">a</span><span class="g">n</span><span class="g">n</span><span class="g">u</span><span class="w">n</span><span class="w">c</span><span class="g">l</span><span class="g">u</span><span class="g">s</span></span></span></span>, which can be obtained by <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandButcherToggle.png" /></span>Butchering</span></span></span> the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SlogCorpse.png" /></span>corpse</span> of Slog</span></span>. It can be reduced greatly by simply having <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shake It Off.png" /></span>Shake</span> It Off</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Poison Tolerance.png" /></span>Poison</span> Tolerance</span></span>. If this wasn't bad enough, the beam projectile itself has a <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv"><span class="nowrap">PV</span></span></span> of 15 and can do 1d5 + 7 points of extra damage per penetration, so <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> is very important in this fight.

All of this is to say, do **NOT** get hit by the beam, it hurts.

Once the Nephilim has begun to fire its Irisdual Beam, the beam will fire a total of 3 times before going on cooldown. This cannot be stopped in any way other than by killing or pacifying the Nephilim, and it is not recommended to be too close to the Nephilim when it activates its beam as beams tend to overlap at such a close range. <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span>Juke</span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span>Charge</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span>Jump</span></span></span> are excellent tools to use here to cover extra ground if necessary, so don't forget to use them. This is also why improved quickness and move speed scores are recommended here to ensure you don't fall victim to initiative orders and have a beam charge and fire before you get the chance to avoid it. Additionally, if you are in stasis you take no damage from the Irisdual Beam.

In addition to the Irisdual Beam, each Nephilim will occasionally spawn a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Rank Girshling Cresh.png" /></span>girshling</span> cresh</span></span> underneath them, typically soon after firing its Irisdual Beam. Make sure to watch for this and to destroy it (they are extremely fragile), as failure to do so will spawn girshlings in accordance to which Nephilim dropped the cresh. All Nephilim have <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Regeneration.png" /></span>Regeneration</span></span></span> rank 10, so you cannot <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Decapitate.png" /></span>Decapitate</span></span></span> them and they will quickly restore any <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span>Dismembered</span></span></span> limbs.

### Qas

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span> is meant to be fought at the same time as her sister <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span>, and by being brought to the Spindle she becomes an easier fight than normal. Still, <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span> can be dangerous as any Nephilim can be dangerous, but she doesn't have any extra dangerous powers. She is only immune to confusion gas, so if you rely on <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Confusion.png" /></span>Confusion</span></span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Stinger (Confusing Venom).png" /></span>Stinger</span> (Confusing Venom)</span></span> to lower <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap">MA</span></span></span> for psychic attacks, they will still work on <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span>. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span> has 2 natural weapons, both being <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span>Cudgels</span></span></span>. Care should be taken not to get stunned; padded gear is a great security. If you notice yourself being dazed, simply step away to shake off the daze and come back when it has worn off.

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span> is associated with <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Polarized Girshling.png" /></span>polarized</span> girshlings</span></span>, which can create force fields around themselves.

### Qon

As we discussed with <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> is meant to be fought alongside her sister but instead can be fought alone if summoned to the Spindle. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> has a unique gimmick in that all creatures that can see <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> will be constantly inflicted with confusion. Combine this with the Irisdual Beam and it can be _extremely_ lethal. It is highly recommended to have <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Iron Mind.png" /></span>Iron</span> Mind</span></span> (or better yet, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Two-headed.png" /></span>Two-headed</span></span></span>) to shake off the confusion. The confusion effect is a DC 25 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower"><span class="nowrap">Willpower</span></span></span> save for every turn you have line of sight to <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span>, and lasts from 10-15 turns.

It may go without saying, but without <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Two-headed.png" /></span>Two-headed</span></span></span> your best bet is to take the <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Iron Mind.png" /></span>Iron</span> Mind</span></span> skill and boost your <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower"><span class="nowrap">Willpower</span></span></span> with items like the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Psychodyne Helmet.png" /></span>psychodyne</span> helmet</span></span> (just make sure it doesn't penalize your <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> _too_ much). If you happen to have <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SphynxSaltTonic.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="C">s</span><span class="c">p</span><span class="m">h</span><span class="M">y</span><span class="C">n</span><span class="c">x</span></span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="Y">salt</span></span> injectors</span></span> stocked up, you can use them for some temporary confusion immunity. Something of a more advanced strategy is that the icon of an item in your inventory is _not_ scrambled during confusion; if you memorize which of your tonics is the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SphynxSaltTonic.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="C">s</span><span class="c">p</span><span class="m">h</span><span class="M">y</span><span class="C">n</span><span class="c">x</span></span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="Y">salt</span></span> injector</span></span> you can inject it to cure confusion. If you're a true kin, <span class="injected"><span class="cybernetic"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/IntravenousPort.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="Y">intravenous</span> port</span></span></span></span> doubles this duration making them more effective and the <span class="injected"><span class="cybernetic"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/MedassistModule.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="Y">medassist</span> module</span></span></span></span> can be loaded with sphynx salt to automatically cure you of confusion. However, only use the <span class="injected"><span class="cybernetic"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/MedassistModule.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="Y">medassist</span> module</span></span></span></span> if you are swimming in sphynx salt or you combo it with <span class="injected"><span class="cybernetic"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/IntravenousPort.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="Y">intravenous</span> port</span></span></span></span> as you will likely burn through those injectors since this will be a long fight.

If you find yourself confused with the Irisdual Beam firing, you must be _extremely careful_ about your next steps. Ideally, you will have a source of <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandFlyToggle.png" /></span>Flight</span></span></span> that you can activate. If you can fly, you can retreat to the world map and wait out the duration of the confusion. This will result in <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> being in a new location when you return; potentially even a new zone but it is better than death. Don't forget that activating <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span>Sprint</span></span></span> is also very helpful here, as it will give you the necessary speed to be able to dodge the beams. Look at your character and see if they are highlighted in red. If they are, you're in the killzone and need to move out of it. The beams go from <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> to you, so move perpendicular to the direction of <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> to get out of the way in as few turns as possible. If you aren't highlighted red but the beam hasn't fired yet, **don't wait**. Waiting will break your <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span>Sprint</span></span></span> so unless this is the 3rd beam you want to make sure you still have <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span>Sprint</span></span></span> going for the next beam. Instead, move parallel to the direction of <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> since it'll be less likely you walk back into the beam. Remember where you came from and move back and forth until the beam fires and you're highlighted again.

Just to make things even more difficult, <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> can also fly. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span> really got the short end of the stick huh? If you don't have <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandFlyToggle.png" /></span>Flight</span></span></span>, you will be in a serious pit as all Nephilim have a reflective shield to divert projectiles until disabled with an EMP. Like <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> is _not_ immune to being confused outside of confusion gas, so you are able to utilize this to deal significant damage with mental attacks like with other Nephilim. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> has one natural weapon which is an <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span>Axe</span></span></span>. She does not have any <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span>Axe</span></span></span> skills, so do not worry about dismemberment but critical hits can reduce your <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span>.

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> is associated with <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Cryptic Girshling.png" /></span>cryptic</span> girshlings</span></span>, which release confusion gas upon death.

### Rermadon

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon</span></span></span> is luckily much less complex than <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span>. They are immune to plasma so you won't be able to lower their resistances, but you can still damage them with other elemental damage types. In that sense, they are fairly similar to <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span>, the main difference being in the girshlings associated and the weapon type of their natural weapon. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon</span></span></span> uses an <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span>Axe</span></span></span>, but like other Nephilim does not have any skills to "properly" use it.

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon</span></span></span> is associated with <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Plasmatic Girshling.png" /></span>plasmatic</span> girshlings</span></span>, which release plasma gas on death.

### Agolgot

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span> is another fairly simple Nephilim. He has 2 natural weapons which are <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span>Long</span> Blades</span></span> meaning they have extra <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv"><span class="nowrap">PV</span></span></span> on critical hits. Other than that, he spawns girshlings that have the capability to cause an ooze effect on hit: rusting an object, poison, or inflicting stiff legs/sore throat. Note that they do _not_ need to penetrate for this to take place. Since <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span> will be fought on the surface in this instance, these girshlings are only capable of inflicting stiff legs. However, if you fight <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span> in his lair (not during this quest), do note that they can inflict sore throat depending on the strata.

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span> is associated with <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rank Girshling.png" /></span>rank</span> girshlings</span></span>, which can cause an ooze effect upon melee hit and drop a pool of ooze upon death.

### Bethsaida

I hope you weren't getting comfortable with the simpler Nephilim, because we've arrived at another tricky one. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span> wields two <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span>Short</span> Blade</span></span> natural weapons, which cause bleeding upon critical hits. They have a simple yet effective gimmick: <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span> will clone themselves at 50% <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span>. This clone has all the power of the original, other than the fact that their Irisdual Beam will only fire 3 rays instead of 6. The clone will _also_ spawn creshes of their own as well. The clone will be at 50% of its max <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span>, and Nephilim are not immune to the Irisdual Beam. Since they have hefty resistances, it won't do full damage but if you get <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span> or their clone to stand in the path of the other's Irisdual Beam, you can do upwards of 130 damage per beam.

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span> is associated with <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Conjoined Girshling.png" /></span>conjoined</span> girshlings</span></span>, which split into 2 girshlings when killed.

### Shug'ruith

Finally, we come to <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span>. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span> wields a single <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span>Cudgel</span></span></span> as its weapon of choice, so deal with its melee similarly to <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span>. It will always be inside of a wall and typically won't move around, so make sure you notice it. Since it will be inside of a wall, it won't actually be able to spawn its creshes as long as the wall remains intact. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span> is therefore extremely vulnerable to gas grenades like plasma and corrosive gas as it will not move out of them.

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span> is associated with <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Burrowing Girshling.png" /></span>burrowing</span> girshlings</span></span>, which spawn wall tiles as they move underground.

### Utilizing the Golem

Since <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Barathrum.png" /></span>Barathrum</span></span></span> will be inside the Golem with you, it is very important that the Golem stays alive, especially during this fight. _If you are not piloting the Golem, it will **very likely** be destroyed_. The damage of the Irisdual Beam is so great that it will easily tear through the Golem. If you plan on using the Golem against the Nephilim, pilot it for the best chance of both your survival and the Golem's. Otherwise, command it to stay behind so <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Barathrum.png" /></span>Barathrum</span></span></span> survives. If <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Barathrum.png" /></span>Barathrum</span></span></span> dies, you are **not locked out of completing the game**, you will only lose out on a lore dump from <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Barathrum.png" /></span>Barathrum</span></span></span> as you ascend the Spindle.

## Starformed Ehalcodon

In order to fight <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span> in this quest, you must first kill or pacify all 6 naturally occuring Girsh Nephilim. Before we go down this path, know that doing so is difficult in itself, but this difficulty pales in comparison to <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span>. First, let us talk about how best to find the Nephilim.

The cradles of all 6 can be uncovered through sharing secrets with legendary gyre wights. These are not easy to find; but one of the best places to search are flower fields as they are easy to traverse and have the best chance of having legendary gyre wights spawn. You can also make use of <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Trash Divining.png" /></span>Trash</span> Divining</span></span> and spending large amounts of time underground (as it seems underground strata have the best chance of generating <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Garbage.png" /></span>trash</span></span></span>) to find secrets and hope you get lucky in finding a Nephilim cradle secret. Finally, while you search using any of the above or below methods, you can cover your body in <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/MumblesInfection.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="R">mumbl</span></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">e</span> m</span></span><span class="injected"><span class="R">outh</span></span></span></span> to learn secrets as you explore zones in order to reduce your total time spent searching.

### Bethsaida and Agolgot

Both <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span> are found in the same places every time; <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span> is found by following the hole in the Mechanimist compound at the bottom of Bethesda Susa straight down and <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span> is found in the same way, but via the hole at the bottom of Golgotha.

### Rermadon, Qas and Qon

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon's</span></span></span> cradle is found on the Palladium Reef, while the chuppah of <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> is found in the Moon Stair. The actual locations are randomized each run, so while you know where to look you won't be able to go right to it. To make things more inconvenient they can be found in any zone, not just the center one. This means if you are going to be manually searching you need a methodical approach.

My suggested way of combing these places for the Nephilim is as follows:

- Pick a parasang in the southern tip of the environment
- Enter that parasang
- Move south to the southern zone, then explore the southwest and southeast zones
    - When I say "explore", I mean only visit that zone and immediately return
- Move back to the center zone
- Explore the east and west zones
- Move to the north zone
- Explore the northeast and northwest zones
- Move to the southern zone of the next parasang to the north

As you do this, if you find the cradle of <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon</span></span></span> or chuppah of <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span>, you will receive a notification that you have done so and your search is complete. As you repeat this pattern, you will explore every single zone of every parasang in a north-to-south strip. Once you complete one strip, you move on to the next strip until you eventually find what you're looking for. In case this explanation was too confusing to follow, here's a video of the process (with god mode turned on for ease of demonstration):

### Shug'ruith the Burrower

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span> is by far and away the most difficult to stumble upon. Their cradle has 2 secrets devoted to it: the mouth and the cradle itself. The cradle is in a random zone _underground_, so the chances you stumble upon the cradle itself are practically zero. The mouth is in a random zone on the surface; again basically a zero chance you stumble upon it randomly but more likely. Since you can find all other Nephilim cradles manually, it's suggested that you find those first and hope you stumble upon a secret telling you where the mouth or cradle for <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span> is in the process.

If you don't happen upon either secret, then you're best off searching for legendary gyre wights to tell you where it is as searching manually is tedious and not worth your time to be frank. If you find the mouth first, you're all set. Finding the cradle from the mouth only requires you to follow any holes in the ground and following the trail of resin left behind by <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span>.

If you find the cradle without finding the mouth, it will actually be deep underground. If you have access to <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Spiral Borer.png" /></span>spiral</span> borers</span></span>, again you're all set: just use them to dig down to the cradle. If not, then you'll need to either look for the borers (you'll need 2) or keep searching for the mouth. The mouth is often quite a distance from the cradle itself, but it will at least narrow your search if you want to search manually.

### Nephilim Order

Once you kill a Nephilim, they give a buff to all the remaining Nephilim. Notably, if you pacify them instead they do not give this buff (pacification requires 1 dram of cloning draught to perform the water ritual and 200 reputation with the Girsh faction). Here are the buffs each Nephilim gives:

- <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span>: 4 limbs with the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Nephal_Claw.png" /></span>spotted</span> claw</span></span> natural weapon
- <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span>: +50% <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span>

Therefore, the order in which you defeat the Nephilim will change how difficult the remainder of the Nephilim are. There are many orders to suggest, but each one will be more or less effective depending on your build. We also must consider the possibility of pacifying Nephilim as well, but for my own sanity I'll be considering pacifying only 1 Nephilim due to how much reputation is necessary. It should go without saying, but if you are able to pacify more that's going to make things easier the more you can pacify rather than kill.

#### Order 1: Elemental Damage Focused

**Pacify: <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span>**

1. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span>
2. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span>
3. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span>
4. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span>
5. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon</span></span></span>

If your build relies on elemental damage as a major focus (such as a <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span>Corrosive</span> Gas Generation</span></span> build), then killing <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon</span></span></span> is a big problem for you as doing so will eliminate your strength. Killing <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon</span></span></span> last allows your build to work on everything else besides <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span>, and pacifying <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span> results in less damage coming your way.

#### Order 2: Low PV

**Pacify: <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span>**

1. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon</span></span></span>
2. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span>
3. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span>
4. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span>
5. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span>

If your build is lower on the <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv"><span class="nowrap">PV</span></span></span> side (such as a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span>Multiweapon</span> Fighting</span></span> build), then you're going to run into massive problems when each Nephilim has over 20 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> post-<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span>. Saving <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span> for last means you can deal with the more manageable 12 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span>, and pacifying <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span> will mean less <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span> for you to chew through.

#### Order 3: Grenades

**Pacify: <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon</span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span>/<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span>**

1. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span>
2. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon</span></span></span>
3. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span>
4. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span>
5. <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Agolgot.png" /></span>Agolgot</span></span></span>

This strategy is a unique one, and it is my recommendation if you don't have some other extremely reliable high-damage build (or even if you do, as a supplementation). The strategy here revolves around abusing the omniphase that <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span> gives the other Nephilim by modding grenades with the phase conjugate mod. If you're not familiar, this will cause the grenade to switch phases just before it explodes and since the Nephilim will be in omniphase post-<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Shugruith.png" /></span>Shug'ruith</span></span></span>, this means that it will affect the Nephilim _but not us_.

Since each Nephilim posses a reflective shield, this shield will make them immune to the effect of a grenade they reflect. The solution is to either EMP the shield first or just don't hit them with the grenade; walk up to the Nephilm and detonate the phase conjugate grenade on yourself. The AOE will catch the Nephilim and since it's phase conjugate it won't affect you.

Which Nephilim you choose to pacify depends on what grenade strategy you wish to employ. If you want to try and keep the Nephilim frozen or try and disintegrate them with fire, you're going to want to pacify <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rermadon.png" /></span>Rermadon</span></span></span> so that the rest of the Nephilim remain susceptible. If you are using a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/HandENuke.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="m">Hand-E-Nuke</span></span></span></span></span>, then it doesn't matter they'll all die with 1 nuke. If you are using explosives or the trusty plasma + gravity grenade wombo combo, then <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Bethsaida.png" /></span>Bethsaida</span></span></span> is a good option in order to make the Nephilim take less grenades to kill. Finally, if you are using flashbang grenades then <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qas.png" /></span>Qas</span></span></span> and/or <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span> are good options since lowering their quickness will allow the confusion from the flashbangs last more effective rounds.

That last option begs a bit of explanation, as you may not see the line of reasoning to cause one to use flashbang grenades on the Nephilim. First off, something to keep in mind is that even a phase conjugate flashbang grenade _will_ still affect you, just with a reduced duration. It's therefore recommended to have some polarized gear in order to reduce the duration further. High duration rolls can still cause you to be confused with a single set of polarized gear, so keep that in mind.

The confused effect does 2 very helpful things: it will lower <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span> and lower <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap">MA</span></span></span> significantly, even into the negatives. A <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/FlashbangGrenade3.png" /></span>flashbang</span> grenade mk III</span></span> reduces <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap">MA</span></span></span> by a whopping 23-24 points (depending on their specific <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower"><span class="nowrap">Willpower</span></span></span> stat) and <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span> by 20 points, making the Nephilim trivial to hit. You may see where I'm headed with this: attacks that target <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap">MA</span></span></span>.

If you have a high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> score, consider gathering some psionic weapons from arch dervishes. Not only will the Nephilim be confused and unable to retaliate properly, but you will also be doing incredible damage as you will easily be able to penetrate 11+ times per hit. The primary weakness to this build is that the Nephilim also have the <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Iron Mind.png" /></span>Iron</span> Mind</span></span> skill, which allows them to somewhat reliably remove the confused effect on them so you'll have to come with a healthy amount of flashbang grenades for this strategy. If you don't have a high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> score, not to worry because the Nephilim do.

In the If, Then, Else quest, if you kill Tau-No after she gifts you the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/TauHeadpiece.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="m">c</span><span class="m">r</span><span class="m">y</span><span class="b">s</span><span class="B">t</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="B">l</span><span class="b">l</span><span class="m">i</span><span class="m">n</span><span class="m">e</span></span></span> halo</span></span>, it will turn into the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/TauDagger.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="m">c</span><span class="m">r</span><span class="m">y</span><span class="b">s</span><span class="B">t</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="B">l</span><span class="b">l</span><span class="m">i</span><span class="m">n</span><span class="m">e</span></span></span> jile</span></span>. The jile is a unique <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span>Short</span> Blade</span></span> that targets <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap">MA</span></span></span> using the _target's <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span>_ to determine <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv"><span class="nowrap">PV</span></span></span>. This means you can have 1 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> and still gain great benefit from this weapon against creatures that have high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> scores themselves and our Nephilim fall within this category. The flashbang will reduce their <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> by a bit, so it will always be better to use psionic weapons instead and have high (34+) <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> but this method will still easily net 100+ damage _per hit_ of the jile. Combine this with <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span>Multiweapon</span> Fighting</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span>Jab</span></span></span> after duplicating the jile with <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Metamorphic Polygel.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="y">m</span><span class="y">e</span><span class="y">t</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="Y">m</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="M">r</span><span class="M">p</span><span class="M">h</span><span class="m">i</span><span class="m">c</span><span class="m"></span> </span><span class="m">p</span><span class="y">o</span><span class="y">l</span><span class="y">y</span><span class="Y">g</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="Y">l</span></span></span></span> and you will be ripping through the Nephilim.

As mentioned, a lot of the trouble with flashbang grenades is that the confusion is often removed by the Nephilim with their <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Iron Mind.png" /></span>Iron</span> Mind</span></span> skill. If you use <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/CrypticGirshling_Bite.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="b">zigzag</span></span></span> fangs</span></span>, they have a 15% chance of applying confused albiet at a lower power than a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/FlashbangGrenade3.png" /></span>flashbang</span> grenade mk III</span></span>. It still is a powerful enough effect to do incredible amounts of damage, but the added benefit is that it is applied on hit and is a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span>Short</span> Blade</span></span>. This means it benefits from <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span>Jab</span></span></span> and you can improve your chance of applying confused by wearing <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Precision Nanon Fingers.png" /></span>precision</span> <span class="injected"><span class="Y">nanon</span></span> fingers</span></span>. With this strategy, you are able to do tons of damage and keep the Nephilim locked down in confusion, resulting in you taking basically zero damage.

You can also utilize this strategy at a distance with the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Psychal Fleshgun.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="w">p</span><span class="w">s</span><span class="w">y</span><span class="r">c</span><span class="R">h</span><span class="M">a</span><span class="M">l</span><span class="m"></span> </span><span class="M">f</span><span class="M">l</span><span class="R">e</span><span class="r">s</span><span class="w">h</span><span class="w">g</span><span class="w">u</span><span class="w">n</span></span></span></span>. You will need high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> for this, but the benefit is that you'll be at a distance from your flashbang grenades and won't get caught up in the detonation. The potential for damage is less than a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span>Multiweapon</span> Fighting</span></span> build unfortunately, but with <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span>Pistol</span></span></span> skills you can fire these extremely fast and make the most of the limited duration of your confusion. You will need to also make sure that you come equipped with EMP grenades to remove the reflective shield and mod your fleshguns to be electromagnetically shielded as they are susceptible to EMP.

### Fighting Ehalcodon

You will have many problems fighting <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span>, so let's first understand what our opponent is capable of. The first and most significant problem is <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon's</span></span></span></span></span> signature mutation, Quantum Fugue. Quantum Fugue has a fixed 100 turn cooldown, is unaffected by normality and most importantly will swap the original creature to the copy with the most <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span> at the end of the duration. This means unless you are able to target all copies equally, you will be doing less damage while Quantum Fugue is in effect.

The second problem is <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon's</span></span></span></span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Rank Girshling Cresh.png" /></span>girshling</span> cresh</span></span>. Normally, the girshlings aren't an extreme threat but in the case of <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span> they are the #1 most important creature. You must kill every cresh and every girshling it spawns as soon as you possibly can, or you will die.

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span> and qyr girshlings have a unique property where they will refract the Irisdual Beam if they are hit by it and take far less damage than normal from it. This refraction can refract the beam into other girshlings which will refract it further and quickly cover the entire map with the Irisdual Beam. This problem is heavily amplified while <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon's</span></span></span></span></span> Quantum Fugue clones are alive, as each one can drop their own cresh. To make this worse, the Irisdual Beam has a low enough cooldown where <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon's</span></span></span></span></span> clones can _always use it_ at least once within the duration of Quantum Fugue.

You don't need to be able to predict how the Irisdual Beam will refract as the game will display this information, but this refraction will take up a significantly larger space than prior Nephilim. High movement speed and <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Teleportation.png" /></span>Teleportation</span></span></span> becomes important in ensuring you can avoid this. A helpful tip is to drag <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span> near a zone edge and change zones when qe activates Irisdual Beam. This way, you can wait out the beams in safety and return when <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span> has stopped firing.

This is of course the obvious route to take. Instead, you can utilize a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/StasisGrenade3.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="m">stasis</span></span></span> grenade mk III</span></span> when <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span> starts spinning up the Irisdual Beam. When the screen becomes full of red and you won't be able to move to safety in time, pop that stasis grenade on yourself. While in stasis, you are immune to all damage and this includes damage from Irisdual Beam. A mk III grenade lasts a minimum of 6 turns, which is also how long Irisdual Beam takes to get through all beams.

The creshes are very weak so coming stocked with resonance or high explosive grenades is advised in order to mass-cull the creshes when the Quantum Fugue clones inevitably spawn several at once or to kill the girshlings if they happen to spawn. High explosive grenades will have a larger AOE, but this draws more risk in blowing yourself up so do be careful with your choice.

Your general strategy should be the following:

- Allow <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span> to fire Irisdual Beam

- Kite around the clones, throwing grenades at any creshes that spawn
- Dodge the Quantum Fugue enhanced Irisdual Beam
- Wait for Quantum Fugue to expire
- Attack <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span>
- Dodge Irisdual Beam

- Dodge Irisdual Beam
- Attack <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon</span></span></span></span></span> until qe uses Quantum Fugue

During this fight, you should make heavy use of grenades to supplement your damage. Plasma is especially helpful in allowing freeze grenades to work; carrying a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Spaser Rifle.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="K">s</span><span class="g">p</span><span class="G">a</span><span class="G">s</span><span class="g">e</span><span class="K">r</span></span></span> rifle</span></span> can be quite handy in order to reapply the coated in plasma debuff. Flashbang grenades combined with <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap">MA</span></span></span> targeting attacks can be absolutely devastating, but due to <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ehalcodon.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">Ehalcodon's</span></span></span></span></span> even better <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower"><span class="nowrap">Willpower</span></span></span> than other Nephilim it becomes a challenge to keep qem confused.

Some additional things to consider:

- You can use <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Wall.png" /></span>Force</span> Wall</span></span> in combination with a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Longreach Grappling Gun.png" /></span>longreach</span> grappling gun</span></span> in order to quickly escape an Irisdual Beam path
