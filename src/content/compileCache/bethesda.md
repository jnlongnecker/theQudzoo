# Decoding the Signal

Having proven ourselves, we were accepted into the Barathrumite enclave. Our work has only begun; we have been tasked to decode a strange signal and need the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Baetyl.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="G">baetyl</span></span></span></span> at the bottom of Bethesda Susa to do so. Make sure to pack a coat. Live and drink, apprentice.

The chosen few that make it past Golgotha are not always so lucky with the sequel, Bethesda Susa. At this point, we should be expecting the Qud punch but somehow, Bethesda Susa manages to surprise. Our first obstacle is actually entering the dungeon.

## Initial Threats

To complete the dungeon, we need to have an answer to 3 enemies; 2 of which can be found often at the entrance. The first enemy is the cragmensch (these being the suite of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Cragmensch Boulderer.png" /></span><span class="object">cragmensch boulderers</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Cragmensch Brainer.png" /></span><span class="object">cragmensch brainers</span></span>, and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Cragmensch Luminary.png" /></span><span class="object">cragmensch luminary</span></span>), and the solution is quite simple. If you have a vibro weapon, you're set. At this point, it's not particularly common for you to have such a weapon, so instead any sort of elemental modded weapon is perfect. Having the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Penetrating Strikes.png" /></span><span class="skill">Penetrating Strikes</span></span> skill from the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span> tree also makes fighting these guys a breeze since you bypass all that <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> and are guaranteed at least 1 penetration. Alternatively, if you have above 9 <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span>, you could melee them to death normally. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axes</span></span> also work well because of the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cleave.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cleave</span></span>.

Cragmensch aren't the difficult ones, but not having a reliable way of killing them makes Bethesda Susa agony as it's filled to the brim with them. The second enemy we need a solution for right at the start is the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rimewyk.png" /></span><span class="object">rimewyk</span></span>. It always starts with its perfectly accurate and immense range frost breath, which is nearly guaranteed to instantly freeze you. There are some runs where you'll never see one, and there are some where you'll see quite a few; so if you want to take the gamble that you won't encounter one, go for it. If you do encounter a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rimewyk.png" /></span><span class="object">rimewyk</span></span> unprepared, they can very easily kill you. We have a few solutions to deal with them though.

The first and most obvious solution is to simply have high cold resistance. While this is the most obvious, it's also one of the hardest to attain by this point. The <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weathered.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weathered</span></span> skill and ape fur items will be our primary form of cold resistance and we can supplement this with wooly modded items. If we really go hard with tinkered items, ape fur items and the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weathered.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weathered</span></span> skill, we can get around 60-80 cold resistance. This would compromise some of our durability in the process, and requires very specific investment. In actuality, you'll probably have closer to 30 cold resistance comfortably, which isn't enough to really save you against a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rimewyk.png" /></span><span class="object">rimewyk</span></span>.

If you happen to have a highly leveled <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Carapace</span></span>, this is the perfect mutation for this dungeon as it provides tons of armor and cold resistance. The <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Freezing Ray.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Freezing Ray</span></span> mutation also lowers your brittle temperature, which is the temperature that you freeze at. Having this, especially with a few ranks, will mean you don't get _frozen_ but you'll still take the cold _damage_, which is still bad. Finally, we can also use cold cooking effects for cold resistance. The only issue is that the ingredients are expensive and provide a variety of effects, meaning you may not get the cold resistance you're looking for easily. Once inside Bethesda Susa, convalescence is plentiful; but you still retain the issue of lots of effects to cycle through.

> üóíÔ∏è Note: There are many ways of gaining cold resistance, I simply covered the most common and accessible ways here. If you happen to have 70+ cold resistance in other ways, you should be good to go combating the freeze and cold damage of a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rimewyk.png" /></span><span class="object">rimewyk</span></span>.

Alternatively to cold resistance, we could instead obtain several <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/BlazeTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="r">b</span><span class="r">l</span><span class="R">a</span><span class="W">z</span><span class="Y">e</span></span> injectors</span></span> to counter the freezing effect. While <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rimewyk.png" /></span><span class="object">rimewyk</span></span> are still extremely dangerous, even unfrozen, if we can fight back that gives us a chance. Fighting it poses another challenge, however. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rimewyk.png" /></span><span class="object">Rimewyk</span></span> have very good <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>, which means we need a way of countering that. The <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Horns</span></span> mutation and abilities that don't roll to hit will be our bread and butter. In particular, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Hook and Drag.png" /></span><span class="skill">Hook and Drag</span></span> is an excellent skill since you're guaranteed to hit all the attacks you make as you move.

The last option we have is to become friends with unshelled reptiles. The easiest way to do this is to obtain a single <span class="injected"><span class="g">s</span><span class="G">c</span><span class="W">a</span><span class="w">l</span><span class="g">e</span><span class="G">d</span></span> item; either through <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span> or just finding it in the world. If you don't want to wear the item through Bethesda Susa, you can instead use it to be neutral with legendary <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Croc.png" /></span><span class="object">crocs</span></span> and water ritual them for more permanent reputation. We'll need either 3 <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Croc.png" /></span><span class="object">crocs</span></span> or 2 and at least 1 secret. We can also find <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Salamander.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="R">salamanders</span></span></span></span> in the desert canyons in case we don't find enough <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Croc.png" /></span><span class="object">croc</span></span> lairs. Whichever way you choose to gain the rep, as long as you end up neutral you can ignore the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rimewyk.png" /></span><span class="object">rimewyk</span></span>. In fact, they will be aggressive to the other enemies in the dungeon and are very adept at killing anything around them.

## The Trolls

Once we've entered Bethesda Susa, the first floor gives us a taste of the kinds of creatures we can expect. The second floor is where we start to face off against the 3 guardian trolls of Bethesda Susa. Let's dive into how we get past each one.

### Jotun, Who Parts Limbs

![Player Nomad with Jotun to the northwest, in a convalessence pool]($assetsDir/images/quests/bethesda-jotun.png)

And part limbs he does. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun</span></span> doesn't have special gimmicks like the other trolls, he is simply a warrior specializing in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axes</span></span>. While he does dual wield two-handed <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axes</span></span>, he is also capable of mid-range combat with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/ThrowingAxe.png" /></span><span class="object">throwing axes</span></span>, but these don't benefit from any <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axe</span></span> skills. If you plan on killing <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun</span></span>, your strategies will differ greatly based on your build at this point in the game, so I won't cover all the possibilities. Instead, I'll offer solutions to counter <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun's</span></span> abilities.

If you have the <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> to stand up to the <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> of the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/ThrowingAxe.png" /></span><span class="object">throwing axes</span></span> (13), then you can sit back on the edge of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun's</span></span> throwing range and spew out sower seeds at him. If he can throw his axes, he tends to do so instead of trying to continue approaching. By sitting as far back as possible, he will have poor accuracy while you don't care about accuracy since you're throwing explosives. If you have low <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> though, don't count on it helping you against the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/ThrowingAxe.png" /></span><span class="object">throwing axes</span></span>. If the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/ThrowingAxe.png" /></span><span class="object">throwing axe</span></span> lands in your square, it will hit you, and if your <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> is low it can easily hit in the 70s for damage. If you find yourself in one of those situations where you need to approach and fight in melee, you'll want to avoid both the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/ThrowingAxe.png" /></span><span class="object">throwing axes</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun's</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>. Fighting him in the convalescence will only make him more dangerous from its healing effects. Instead, draw his attention and then hide behind a pillar.

To fight <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun</span></span> in melee combat, you should definitely have as high <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> as you can find. With the immense amount of damage he does, you need to be sure you can take a few hits when he inevitably connects. If you can disarm him, while it doesn't completely solve his threat he is much less dangerous without his most powerful <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axe</span></span>. If you get hooked via <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Hook and Drag.png" /></span><span class="skill">Hook and Drag</span></span>, using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> (swapping with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun</span></span>) will break the hook and allow you to get away. Additionally, grenades are always very helpful here. Freeze grenades, even mk II, can keep <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun</span></span> stuck in place for quite a while. Just make sure you don't freeze yourself or have some <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/BlazeTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="r">b</span><span class="r">l</span><span class="R">a</span><span class="W">z</span><span class="Y">e</span></span> injectors</span></span> to keep on the offense while <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun</span></span> takes an ice bath.

You can alternatively use some sort of forcefield to keep him at bay while you again either throw grenades at him or shoot at him, ideally with the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Carbine.png" /></span><span class="object">carbine</span></span> we received from the previous quest. You are guaranteed to find a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Force Bracelet.png" /></span><span class="object">force bracelet</span></span> at Bey Lah on <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Keh.png" /></span><span class="object">Hindriarch Keh</span></span> for purchase. Finally, if you managed to get the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Hologram Bracelet.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="b">h</span><span class="B">o</span><span class="C">l</span><span class="c">o</span><span class="b">g</span><span class="B">r</span><span class="C">a</span><span class="c">m</span></span> bracelet</span></span> or found one by other means, you can use it to distract <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun</span></span> again long enough for you to kill him. It works better the closer he is to the hologram and the further you are from the troll. Once <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun</span></span> is dead, you can take the key and advance to the next guardian.

### Fjorn-Kosef, Who Knits the Icy Lattice

![Player Nomad in frozen webbing with Fjorn-Kosef to the northeast, south of a convalessence pool]($assetsDir/images/quests/bethesda-fjorn.png)

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 2.png" /></span><span class="object">Fjorn-Kosef</span></span> is easily the weakest of the trio; a little cold resistance and he is of no concern. He will start off with his unique mutation where he spawns frozen webbing around you from a distance. Simply walk out of it and continue towards <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 2.png" /></span><span class="object">Fjorn-Kosef</span></span>. In melee, he attacks with his <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Fjolnir Fist.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="C">ice-encrusted fists</span></span></span></span> which are nowhere near as dangerous as <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun's</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axes</span></span>. He can stun with them as they are <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span>, so the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shake It Off.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shake It Off</span></span> skill is quite handy to have.

All the strategies about taking <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun</span></span> on at a range apply to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 2.png" /></span><span class="object">Fjorn-Kosef</span></span> as well and, unlike <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 2.png" /></span><span class="object">Fjorn-Kosef</span></span> has no countermeasures at range aside from the frozen webbing. As long as you don't stand in it, this is an easy fight.

### Haggabah, Who Plies the Umbral Path

![Player Nomad with Haggabah to the northeast, north of a wall with a Troll Foal to his northwest]($assetsDir/images/quests/bethesda-haggabah.png)

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> is an interesting fellow. He is indeed invisible, but as you can plainly tell by the screenshot, we have ways of revealing him. If you are a mutant, we can use one of a variety of mutations in order to reveal him: <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Clairvoyance.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Clairvoyance</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Night Vision.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Night Vision</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Hearing.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Heightened Hearing</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sense Psychic.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Sense Psychic</span></span>. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Clairvoyance.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Clairvoyance</span></span> lasts only as long as its reveal duration, so it's one of the more temperamental solutions. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Hearing.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Heightened Hearing</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sense Psychic.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Sense Psychic</span></span> are perhaps the most effective, as they reveal the location of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> as long as he is within range.

If you have none of these mutations or are a true kin, we can use any form of night vision (like from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Night-vision Goggles.png" /></span><span class="object">night-vision goggles</span></span> or the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/NightVision.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">night vision</span></span></span></span> cybernetic) to reveal <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> except the form granted by <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SkulkTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="b">s</span><span class="b">k</span><span class="B">u</span><span class="b">l</span><span class="b">k</span></span> injectors</span></span>. The caveat to this is that <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> cannot be in a light source, which the convalescence generates. Therefore, you'll want to draw him to the edges of the arena in order to see him. Additionally, if you have the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/PenetratingRadar.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">penetrating radar</span></span></span></span> cybernetic or <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Night-Sight Interpolators.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="K">night-sight</span></span> interpolators</span></span> those also will work here and don't rely on <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> to be in darkness.

If you have none of these options, well then you're in quite the pickle aren't you? We can instead lure <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> into the convalescence as a trap to reveal his location. Let's observe the following example:

<span>![Gif of Player Nomad moving left with 3 Troll Foals following, 1 of them bloody]($assetsDir/images/quests/bethesda-invisible1.gif)</span>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah's</span></span> AI likes to make things hard for us by moving randomly every once in a while. But we can use clues in the terrain to aid our guesses to where he is. For some context, just before this gif started, the bloody <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll Foal.png" /></span><span class="object">troll foal</span></span> had just spawned, which tells me it budded off of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span>. This tells me that <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> is likely in the tile with the convalescence puddle next to the bloody pool. Later, a pool of convalescence becomes bloody and then another puddle appears where no enemy is. This further tells me where <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> is. I move closer at the end of the gif to see if I attack him or get attacked, but neither happens. This is thanks to the random movement AI. I have, however, determined he is either right next to me or very close, which is all I need.

![Gif of Player Nomad not moving while a Troll Foal attacks from the left and a corpse on the right]($assetsDir/images/quests/bethesda-invisible2.gif)

In this sequence, I am holding `ctrl` as I press a movement direction. This ensures that I don't move, and I only attack if there is something in the direction I attack. I use this to first check the empty tiles around me, and since I don't attack this tells me <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> is not next to me. I then kill the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll Foal.png" /></span><span class="object">troll foal</span></span> on the right as I think it's between me and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span>. I check the empty tiles again, since if I attack where the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll Foal.png" /></span><span class="object">troll foal</span></span> was, I'll attack the corpse. When I don't attack anything again, I then attack the tile with the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Troll Corpse.png" /></span><span class="object">troll corpse</span></span>. Even though no animation plays, I can hear the sounds of my attack (this doesn't help you in gif form), but I also see that my attack animation does not play and that the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll Foal.png" /></span><span class="object">troll foals</span></span> are acting. This means that I did attack, and since no animation played it means I attacked <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> and not the corpse. You'll notice that it seems like I do nothing while the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll Foal.png" /></span><span class="object">troll foal</span></span> just scratches at my back, but I'm actually killing <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> here. You can see a popup at the very end, which is the corner of the popup that appears when you kill a legendary creature, letting me know I successfully killed <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span>.

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah's</span></span> weapons deal umbral damage on hit, which is primarily where his damage comes from. This damage type cannot be reduced in any way. If you are planning to fight him in melee, you will want to have a decent <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> score or just DPS race him. The ranged options discussed with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun</span></span> work here as well, just with the added complication that <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> is a bit tricky to see. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> truly has no ranged attacks, so if you can keep your distance from him this fight will go better.

While there are nearly infinite ways to actually go about the killing of the trolls, a particular weapon stands out above the rest as something obtainable by this point and having extreme killing efficiency against the trolls (and virtually everything else). This weapon is the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Flamethrower.png" /></span><span class="object">flamethrower</span></span>; if you are able to find one (or craft one with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span>) by this point, it is perhaps the most powerful weapon you can reasonably use for this dungeon. I could spend pages dissecting every weapon and how they fare in Bethesda Susa, but I will simply leave it here as I find the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Flamethrower.png" /></span><span class="object">flamethrower</span></span> to be in a unique spot where it is technically accessible by now and performs extraordinarily.

## The Cheese

You didn't honestly think I was going to leave you to just fight it out now did you? We certainly have better solutions. The first we'll cover is certainly the simplest; we just dig around them. The trolls typically spawn far enough away that they will not aggro onto you as soon as you go down the stairs. We can use this to our advantage by simply digging into the walls and into the small hut on the opposite side where the stairs are. For an example of what I'm talking about, look no further:

<span>![Player Warden at the end of a long tunnel dug in the wall of a troll chamber starting at the staircase]($assetsDir/images/quests/bethesda-cheese.png)</span>

To the far left, you can see where I came into the room and started digging. Now look carefully at the walls to the north of my character. You can see that the wall to my direct northwest extends further upwards, which tells me that the walls to the right of it will lead into the room behind the door. By breaking down one of these walls, we can move down to the next room and repeat. Just make sure you bring a capable digging method if you decide to do this.

Digging is not our only solution. We can alternatively use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Phasing</span></span> or our phase silk to pass through the wall and down the stairs. Care should be taken of choosing this option, since the trolls can and will open the door to get to you (the foals will be unable to open the door though). Do your best to combine <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> to drop aggro as you pass through the wall, that way you can reset your cooldowns before advancing and won't have the troll pop in on you.

If you are a fan of making friends, the trolls are no exception. They exist in the criminally underused Troll faction, and can be made neutral like any other faction. Unfortunately, the 3 guardian trolls are the only legendary trolls in the game, so if you want to get this before going to Bethesda Susa, you'll have some difficulty and will have to rely on RNG through legendary relations and Schrodinger pages. If you've learned anything so far, I do not like leaving things to chance; we have a better solution if this is the path you want to take.

Instead, we can take with us a few <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/LoveTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">l</span><span class="R">o</span><span class="Y">v</span><span class="Y">e</span></span> injectors</span></span>. If you equip one in your hand and stab the troll with it, you will gain a new troll friend for a considerable amount of time. We can then water ritual the troll and have them donate their key; so we don't even need to break down the wall! Stabbing in melee is the obvious way of applying injectors, but you can also throw them at your target. This makes injection safe and reliable from a distance, but if you have poor <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> you may be inaccurate the further you are from the target. The <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Deft Throwing.png" /></span><span class="skill">Deft Throwing</span></span> skill and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/ParabolicMuscularSubroutine.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">parabolic muscular subroutine</span></span></span></span> cybernetic makes things more reliable.

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 1.png" /></span><span class="object">Jotun</span></span> is the scariest to do this against since he can kill you the fastest, but unless you are foolishly under equipped you should be more than capable of successfully injecting him. By water ritualing the first 2 trolls, you won't quite have enough reputation to leave <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> neutral to you. However, you can share a single secret which will push you over the edge to neutrality.

Luckily, you can (sort of) reliably find out a secret that is shareable with the trolls: the location of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Stopsvaalinn.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="R">S</span><span class="r">t</span><span class="K">o</span><span class="y">p</span><span class="Y">s</span><span class="R">v</span><span class="r">a</span><span class="K">l</span><span class="y">i</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="R">n</span></span></span></span>. Not only is <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Stopsvaalinn.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="R">S</span><span class="r">t</span><span class="K">o</span><span class="y">p</span><span class="Y">s</span><span class="R">v</span><span class="r">a</span><span class="K">l</span><span class="y">i</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="R">n</span></span></span></span> a powerful <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span>, but it's also one of the few legendary items that trolls will accept the secret for. Even better for us is that 2 different factions will give us the location of this artifact, and both of them are very easy to gain reputation with: the Barathrumites and the Mechanimists. This means that as long as you can water ritual the first two trolls, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span> will leave you alone if you know the location of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Stopsvaalinn.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="R">S</span><span class="r">t</span><span class="K">o</span><span class="y">p</span><span class="Y">s</span><span class="R">v</span><span class="r">a</span><span class="K">l</span><span class="y">i</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="R">n</span></span></span></span>. This is particularly handy since we can't see <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span><span class="object">Haggabah</span></span>, and if we can't see him, we can't trade with him, even if we figure out where he is. The final thing to mention about this strategy is you can shoot injectors with a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Dart Gun.png" /></span><span class="object">dart gun</span></span> purchasable from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Neek.png" /></span><span class="object">Neek</span></span> in Grit Gate (less reliable than throwing to be honest) and that <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/LoveTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">l</span><span class="R">o</span><span class="Y">v</span><span class="Y">e</span></span> injectors</span></span> can rarely fail if you are a lower level than your target.

> üóíÔ∏è Note: A common enough strategy is to use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Clairvoyance.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Clairvoyance</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Teleportation.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Teleportation</span></span> together to blink into the small room. I don't recommend this strategy since it not only requires two specific mutations but also requires considerable investment in the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Teleportation.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Teleportation</span></span> mutation. Low-level <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Teleportation.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Teleportation</span></span> can easily miss the room or, even worse, send you into the waiting arms of that room's troll. Yondercane suffers a similar issue as it replicates level 1 <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Teleportation.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Teleportation</span></span>.

An additional strategy you can use if you happen to have it is to simply deploy a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Spiral Borer.png" /></span><span class="object">spiral borer</span></span> from the surface zone next to the Bethesda Susa entrance. Move down to strata 14 and dig over into the compound to just skip the whole dungeon. Just make sure you have that Mechanimist reputation first.

## The Ruined Ward

Now that we're properly in the compound, we will have to address the final noteworthy enemy here: the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Gyrohumor.png" /></span><span class="object">gyrohumor</span></span>. Unlike their single headed variation, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Gyrohumor.png" /></span><span class="object">gyrohumors</span></span> will cycle between elements they embody. Since they do elemental damage (and a considerable amount of it), our best way of fighting them is to not be near them. If we have high <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>, we can dodge most of their attacks as they have terrible <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>, but be prepared to retreat early since they can stun you and they do a considerable amount of damage if you do not have resistances.

Upon death, they explode and deal damage in line with their form. The heat form will heat you so much you will be heavily ignited, the cold form will cool you far past the point of freezing, the acid form will spray acid on you and the electric form will release a discharge on you. That looks to me like 4 good reasons not to kill them in melee, so be sure to bring a reliable ranged weapon to deal with them (like the Sparbine, hmm?). Forcefields do particularly well at enforcing our desired social distancing, resulting in yet another excellent reason to retrieve the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Force Bracelet.png" /></span><span class="object">force bracelet</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Stopsvaalinn.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="R">S</span><span class="r">t</span><span class="K">o</span><span class="y">p</span><span class="Y">s</span><span class="R">v</span><span class="r">a</span><span class="K">l</span><span class="y">i</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="R">n</span></span></span></span> before arriving at Bethesda Susa.

If you're concerned about the creatures in here, you actually only need to be capable of surviving 4 floors instead of the 8 creature-filled floors of Bethesda Susa. On each floor, there is a platform that will take you to the 5th and 11th floors. By pressing the switch, it will bring the platform to you so just stand on the platform and press it again to go down to the 11th floor.

## The Compound

On the 14th floor, we come across a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Phase Spider.png" /></span><span class="object">phase spider</span></span> and a sealed door. We can either:

1. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandHarvestToggle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Harvest</span></span> the phase silk, cook with it and gain <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Phasing</span></span> and phase through the wall.
2. Step in the phase web to begin <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Phasing</span></span>, and walk through the wall before it wears off.
3. Teleport past with a mutation or yondercane.
4. Mine one of the walls.
5. Oonga-boonga brain regular weapon attack a wall.

Whatever you decide to do, the final floor before the Mechanimist compound is guaranteed to have a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Juicing Cannibal.png" /></span><span class="object">juicing cannibal</span></span> with a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Missile Launcher.png" /></span><span class="object">missile launcher</span></span>. It can and likely will destroy some of the cryochambers; which each contain an enemy you probably won't be capable of defeating. The <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rhinox.png" /></span><span class="object">rhinox</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> are the two that will follow you around, while the plant will just be annoying on this floor only. If either of these two are freed, you can either continue down to the compound before it unfreezes or wait for it to unfreeze and face it. The <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Rhinox.png" /></span><span class="object">rhinox</span></span> is definitely not worth fighting, but <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> will drop his very powerful <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Ceremonial Khopesh.png" /></span><span class="object">ceremonial vibrokhopesh</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SkybearJetpack.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="R">F</span><span class="r">l</span><span class="w">u</span><span class="W">m</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="y">-</span><span class="R">F</span><span class="r">l</span><span class="w">i</span><span class="W">e</span><span class="Y">r</span></span> of the <span class="injected"><span class="b">S</span><span class="B">k</span><span class="C">y</span><span class="c">-</span><span class="b">B</span><span class="B">e</span><span class="C">a</span><span class="c">r</span></span></span></span> on death. If you are interested in fighting <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span>, the next section I will cover some strategies for doing so. Otherwise, drop down to the Mechanimist compound using the elevator.

The compound is considered a holy site to the Mechanimist faction, so they will attack you unless you are favored with them (250+ reputation). It's highly recommended for this quest that you do indeed get at least 250 reputation, as fighting all of the Mechanimists here is a non-trivial task. There are no general tips I can give you if you choose to kill the defenders of the compound; but you will need powerful stats, good equipment, and general good decision-making and experience. You won't be able to escape without pressing the button next to the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Baetyl.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="G">baetyl</span></span></span></span> near the center.

If you have the reputation, this floor is completely peaceful; just collect whatever loot you can carry and insert the disk in the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Baetyl.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="G">baetyl</span></span></span></span>; quest complete. If you don't, good luck on your fight.

### Saad Amus

Ah so greed got the better of you and you want that juicy loot, do you? Before I begin explaining any strategies, the biggest recommendation is to simply come back when you are stronger. If you have an easy way of killing <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> then great, fight on. Otherwise, it's just not worth it as he is a very deadly fighter.

First, lets cover his stats: 160 quickness and 75 in every resistance, 350 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span><span class="stat">HP</span></span>, 12 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> and 6 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>. His attributes are actually fairly low, but it doesn't matter because of his skills and his weapon: the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Ceremonial Khopesh.png" /></span><span class="object">ceremonial vibrokhopesh</span></span>. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> has every <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blade</span></span> skill and every <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span> skill, which means he will always make 2 attacks per attack action (<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Mastery.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weapon Mastery</span></span>) and receive 1 extra penetration than normal (<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Penetrating Strikes.png" /></span><span class="skill">Penetrating Strikes</span></span>). Since the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Ceremonial Khopesh.png" /></span><span class="object">ceremonial vibrokhopesh</span></span> is a vibro weapon, it is extraordinarily likely for him to get 1 penetration per hit; it is expected for him to get 1.561 penetrations per hit precisely.

This means that <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> is expected to get 2.561 penetrations per hit and make 2 attack per round, meaning you're expected to take 5d10 + 10 damage every single time <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> gets a round, which averages to 40 damage per round. Compound this with his high quickness and for every move you make he can easily do around 80 points of damage. High <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> is not very helpful here, as <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> will open with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/En Garde!.png" /></span><span class="skill">En Garde!</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Swipe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Swipe</span></span> in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dueling Stance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dueling Stance</span></span>, which will quicky disarm you of all your weapons and is guaranteed to hit and penetrate at least once (but since it's a vibro weapon, the latter effect rarely is of consequence).

This is quite a bit of damage, which is a bit of a problem. However, there are solutions to be had, and pretty much all of them revolve around <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> just not getting the opportunity to attack you.

The first is <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Corrosive Gas Generation</span></span>. With 75 acid resistance, it's not quite as effective as you may be used to. However, you can take advantage of the fact that <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> comes freeze dried to start and stack up immense densities of gas before he thaws. The <span class="injected"><span class="R">F</span><span class="r">l</span><span class="w">u</span><span class="W">m</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="y">-</span><span class="R">F</span><span class="r">l</span><span class="w">i</span><span class="W">e</span><span class="Y">r</span></span> takes him through every single tile between his start and destination tiles, so if you can get him to fly through the gas he can take incredible amounts of damage at once. In general, it's a good idea to stand in a place where he cannot dash into you, as it will seriously hurt, but with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Corrosive Gas Generation</span></span> this is even more of a good idea as if you can stack up enough gas and get him to dash through enough times, he will die before getting to hit you.

The second is a source of disarm. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> is much weaker without his vibrokhopesh, and is not immune to disarm. While he is immune to _damage_ before fully unfreezing, he is not immune to on-hit/penetrate _effects_ and this includes disarm. You can open up his chamber and shoot him with a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistol</span></span> with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Disarming Shot.png" /></span><span class="skill">Disarming Shot</span></span> (<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/MasterworkChainPistol.png" /></span><span class="object">chain pistols</span></span> recommended), or if you have 100 cold resistance you can walk in and use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Swipe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Swipe</span></span> with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dueling Stance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dueling Stance</span></span>. From there he's very easy to kill as he can just punch you.

The third is with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Pyrokinesis.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Pyrokinesis</span></span>, as you can apply it on <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> without breaking the cyrochamber walls and unfreeze him. This results in him getting unfrozen then immediately frozen again, in which case you can now attack him and harm him (or just keep spamming <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Pyrokinesis.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Pyrokinesis</span></span>) while he remains trapped in the cryochamber. Combine this with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Sunder Mind</span></span> for a pretty free and easy kill.

> üóíÔ∏è Note: You can gain <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Pyrokinesis.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Pyrokinesis</span></span> by cooking with congealed blaze, cured <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Dawnglider.png" /></span><span class="object">dawnglider</span></span> tail, or <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Fire ant.png" /></span><span class="object">fire ant</span></span> gaster paste. Rank 1 <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Pyrokinesis.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Pyrokinesis</span></span> is sufficient!

The fourth is with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Phasing</span></span> and phase-conjugate grenades or with the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Phase-Adaptive Scope.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">phase-adaptive scope</span></span></span></span> cybernetic. You can use this to essentially do the same thing as <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Pyrokinesis.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Pyrokinesis</span></span>, only with thermal grenades. With the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Phase-Adaptive Scope.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">phase-adaptive scope</span></span></span></span>, you can thaw <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> and then blast away at him with your missile weapon of choice. With <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Phasing</span></span> and phase-conjugate grenades, the termal grenades will at least thaw <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> for the moment, but you'll likely need to break in and start shooting him. This lets out the cryogas, which if you are too slow in killing <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> will result in him getting free and attacking you.

These are the safe options. Any other option and you run the risk of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> actually getting a fighting chance. In this case, you'll want to try and lock him down as best as possible. If he pops <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/En Garde!.png" /></span><span class="skill">En Garde!</span></span>, it's recommended that you get some distance and let the duration expire so he doesn't continuously disarm you. If you have 100 cold resistance, freeze grenades mk III will work a charm, just make sure you reapply as necessary as 75 cold resistance will get <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> free quicker than you might want.

Plasma is another great option here, as the duration will last quite a while and make <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span><span class="object">Saad Amus</span></span> very susceptible to the cold of the bottom chambers of Bethesda Susa. Make sure you don't get any on yourself though.
