# How to Make a Build

---

I'm not a big believer in "handing out" builds for you to try; instead I believe in understanding what makes a build effective and then allowing you to shape that knowledge into an experience that is fun and engaging for you (I know, ironic coming from the guy who made a website to share Qud builds). I'll break down making a build into smaller parts to consider and leave it to you to decide what to fit into those pieces.

## Tier 0 - Concept

Before your run even begins, you should have a general plan of what type of build you want to go for. After all, this is going to shape everything from your attribute distribution to your mutations. I'll break down the broad categories of build by their weapon choices as this is going to be the greatest difference between builds. Each build will ideally have a primary and secondary style as backup strategies are always important.

### Melee (Agility & Strength)

Primary melee builds are very common and very powerful due to their reliability. The only "condition" to their power is whether or not they are next to the enemy, so it should be no surprise that once the choice of weapon is settled, you have a strategy for how this build is going to close the gap. Mutations and cybernetics should be focused on increasing your melee damage and increasing your options to get into the fight and stay there.

Secondary melee builds are not going to be worried about how to close the gap and instead focused on how to increase the gap. This leaves <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> as the clear choice of weapon as you will get those utility tools to give your primary weapon the space it needs to go to work.

### Ranged (Agility)

Primary ranged builds have a very slow start until the arrival at Grit Gate since you will be heavily limited by ammunition. Because of this, builds usually transition _into_ being primarily ranged instead of starting there. However, that doesn't mean you should design your character around your secondary style, it just means you'll be a bit weaker until your build can come online. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> in particular excel as primary ranged weapons because of the plethora of fantastic skills they get. These builds should focus on what to do when the enemy closes the gap, because eventually one will. High quickness or movement speed and force fields are fantastic ways to maintain or grow the gap to give your weapons space to work.

Secondary ranged builds are interested in one thing: clearing out the <span class="nowrap">trash.</span> You're likely not specialized enough here to fight powerful enemies solely from a distance, so instead your goal is accurate, long-ranged weapons that can reliably clear out weaker enemies. This leaves rifles as a fantastic choice not only because they are long ranged and accurate, but also because they require very little skill investment.

### Esper (Ego)

Primary <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span> builds are certainly not recommended because of the general unreliability of using nothing but mental mutations as your weapons. Since <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span> powers require no skill investment whatsoever, you should instead have these powers as your secondary style. But, if you are bent on using mental mutations as your primary weapon, be ready to take things very slowly in order to allow your damage to come back online and relying on your secondary when enemies get too close while you're on cooldown.

Secondary <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span> builds are fantastic because they allow you to focus on your primary style entirely. The downside is that while they don't require any skill investment, they do require attribute investment. This leaves secondary <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span> builds to pair extremely well with primary ranged builds since ranged combat only involves 1 attribute and many <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span> attacks are ranged as well.

Something to note with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span> builds is that you should still be wielding a gun and melee weapon, but the point is that the other parts of your build do not need to concern themselves with these. For example, if you are a ranged / <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span> build, you should not consider a mutation like <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stinger</span></span> in order to improve your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axe</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charges</span></span> even if you are planning on wielding an <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axe</span></span>.</span>

## Tier 1 - Weapons

Once you've decided the type of build you're going for, you need to narrow down the types of weapons you're going to use. There's a lot of decisions here for builds using melee, so make sure to consider all the options.

### Melee Weapons

#### Short Blades

| Pros                             | Cons                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High damage as an offhand        | Low damage as a primary weapon                                |

| Allows for hit-and-run tactics   | Requires high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> for skills and high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> for damage |

With melee weapons, you also need to consider whether you are <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> or <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span>.</span> I'll break it down like this:

If you are <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span>,</span> your offhand should always be a <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span>.</span> The only exception is when you are <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span> to try and get more chances for a stun, but even here using an offhand <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> and investing in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> would be preferable.

If you are using a <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span>,</span> you should use anything except a <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span>.</span> <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> are particularly effective with a <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span>.</span> You're probably best off <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span> with the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Ceremonial Khopesh.png" /></span><span class="object">ceremonial vibrokhopesh</span></span> in the long-term with a <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span>,</span> but <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> builds work well with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shields</span></span> as well. If you are using <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Helping Hands.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="R">h</span></span><span class="injected"><span class="Y">elping</span></span><span class="injected"><span class="r"> </span></span><span class="injected"><span class="R">h</span></span><span class="injected"><span class="Y">ands</span></span></span></span>,</span> ensure your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> is in one of your robo-hands.

If you are not <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> or using a <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span>,</span> you should be using a two-handed weapon with <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span>.</span> Even those who are making a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> build, until your build comes online <span class="nowrap">(<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jab</span></span></span> + <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Expertise.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Expertise</span></span>)</span> you should be using a two-handed weapon. Only use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shields</span></span> if you are investing in them.

### Ranged Weapons

#### Bows and Rifles

| Pros                                   | Cons                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Highly accurate                        | Most skills are terrible  |
| High damage per shot                   | Struggles against high <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> |
| Requires virtually no skill investment | Heavy                     |

#### Pistols

| Pros                                                      | Cons                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| High damage over time                                     | Guzzles ammunition              |
| Fantastic skills                                          | Requires many copies of weapons |
| Late game builds have some of the highest damage possible | Mid-ranged                      |

#### Heavy Weapons

| Pros                             | Cons                             |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| High damage                      | Hard to obtain/obtain ammunition |
| Requires little skill investment | Usually inaccurate               |
|                                  | Heavy                            |

As primary weapons, you'll probably swap between using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Bow and Rifle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Bow and Rifles</span></span> early to using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> mid/late game. The earliest <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> you can acquire are very underpowered in comparison to the rifles you can get and these rifles will stay better until you get sufficiently skilled and geared with <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>.</span> A similar story also applies to <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span>,</span> only <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span> are extremely hard to find and the most common <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span> use ammunition like grenades and missiles which are also rare and heavy.

Rifles can be used to great effectiveness without any skills at all - literally none. Of course, if you find yourself using rifles often you'll want to get the basic skills inside and especially if you are primarily using ranged weapons. If you are capable of disarming weapons and you have an internal power source, jacked <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Chain Laser.png" /></span><span class="object">chain <span class="injected"><span class="C">lasers</span></span></span></span> can be reliably found in the mid-game and are extremely powerful weapons to use. There's a lot of options here, but by the late game the king of damage builds will be one that uses <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>.</span>

## Tier 2 - Strategy

Once you know the weapons you'll use and how often you plan on using them, you should consider your plan for the game and what the build tries to accomplish. Your strategy can be largely reduced to 3 different parts. While these will be described as being very general parts of your build, the more you know about the game the more you'll be able to identify where your build will struggle and you can get more and more specific with each part.

### Gimmick

This part of your strategy is at the core of your build. It focuses on a single idea and tries to do it as best as possible. It should not be extremely specific, but should not be so general as to reduce its effectiveness. If you're a ranged build, perhaps your gimmick is high movement speed to always be a step away from the enemy with <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Legs.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Multiple Legs</span></span>,</span> or perhaps your gimmick is <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Phasing</span></span> with gear modded to be phase-conjugate / harmonic. This doesn't necessarily need to be online right at the start, but should be usable in some lesser version at every point in the game. This will be your go-to plan whenever you find a noteworthy enemy.

### Escape

This part of your strategy should be extremely reliable with as few conditions as possible. This is something you save normally and only use when you find yourself backed into a corner. This can be a part of your build or an item you plan on acquiring or both. For example, a melee build may take the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Force Bubble</span></span> mutation in order to escape with a <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Blank Recoiler.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">recoiler</span></span></span></span>,</span> or perhaps they use a combination of the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> speed increase from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Wings.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Wings</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> in order to get away from enemies.

### Solutions

This part of your strategy is solely there for when your gimmick simply doesn't work. With time comes a better understanding of what will counter your gimmick, but you need to have a solution in place for when that time comes. For example, your main gimmick may be to rely on <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Corrosive Gas Generation</span></span> to deal heavy damage and support that with stuns from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span> to keep them in the gas. What do you do when an enemy resists your stuns or is immune to acid? These are the scenarios you need a solution for. If an enemy resists my stuns, perhaps I also have freeze grenades and high cold resistance. If an enemy is immune to acid, perhaps I fall back on my high-damage rifle.

## Tier 3 - Skills

When you're in the run itself, you will organically start to choose skills as you find necessary to deal with the challenges of the build. These should not be planned rigidly and instead flex to integrate the kinds of equipment you find and the enemies you're fighting. Even though there usually is not a rigidly defined sequence of skills to pick up, there is a loose hierarchy to order which skills to pick up first.

### Priority 1 - Offense

As the old saying goes, the best defense is a good offense and this holds true in Qud as well. If the enemy is dead, they can't kill you. The skills you want are going to be shaped from the style of build you're going for, but early on they will almost always focus on the first few melee weapon skills. Melee builds should also go for <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>.</span>

### Priority 2 - Survivability

Once you have your basic weapon skills and you get to the point where you need to start saving up skill points for the next buy or don't meet the prerequisites is when you should start branching out into survivability skills. These are skills like <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Mind&#x27;s Compass.png" /></span><span class="skill">Mind's Compass</span></span>,</span> <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shake It Off.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shake It Off</span></span>,</span> <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weathered.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weathered</span></span> and <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Swift Reflexes.png" /></span><span class="skill">Swift Reflexes</span></span>.</span>

### Priority 3 - Accessories

If your build is flowing well; you're survivable and your combat feels good, start branching off to accessory skills like the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span> tree and secondary weapons. These are designed to let your build "win more" as opposed to getting it online, so be sure that your build is online in some capacity before looking here. Note that your build doesn't have to be _complete_, just functional.

## Tier 4 - Point Spread

During your run, you will have a number of points to use to improve your character. For true kin, this is solely attribute points as cybernetics by their nature are flexible and dynamic. Cybernetics should be adopted as part or support of of the strategy of the build. For mutants, the point spread is both attribute points and mutation points.

### Attribute Points

All attribute points are useful and important, but some to a lesser degree than others. Based off of your builds weapon choices, you will have a primary and secondary attribute: melee ties to <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>,</span> ranged ties to <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span> ties to <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span>.</span> Melee also uniquely has a secondary attribute of <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>,</span> but often times melee builds will secondary into ranged and are covered there. If you are a melee build with a secondary <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span>,</span> you then have two secondary attributes in <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> which may tighten your attribute spread.

Identifying your primary and secondary attributes are important as you'll want to keep them high. Typically, this means your primary attribute sits 2+ points above your secondary, which sits 1+ points above your next highest attribute. This third tier of attribute is typically where <span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness">Toughness</span></span> sits as all builds benefit from it, but may flex to fourth depending on the attribute needs and skill of the player.

<span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower">Willpower</span></span> typically sit relative to one another unless the build calls for one to be higher for part of the strategy, typically beneath or equal to <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness">Toughness</span></span>.</span> For non<span class="nowrap">-<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span></span> builds, <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> sits at the bottom.

These are loose guidelines and meant to be bent to fit the build. However, the bending of the guidelines should come when you have experience and know what thresholds are important for your build and why. So until then, sticking within these ranges should help with consistency.

### Mutation Points

If you are a mutant, you have the additional task of managing the mutation points you gain on each level up. You spend these mutation points to rank up your mutations OR you may spend 4 to gain a new mutation. Typically, it is more effective for your build to spend those 4 mutation points on your existing mutations than to gain another mutation.

Additionally, when making your build you should be careful about choosing too many mutations that hunger for ranks in order to be effective. 3 rank-hungry mutations is the sweet spot, 4 will stretch you just a bit and anything more will start to dilute your power relative to other more focused builds.

Due to the above reason, gaining a new mutation with 4 mutation points not only uses those points _not_ to improve your existing mutations, but also potentially _adds_ another mutation that needs ranks which can really start to stretch you thin. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Chimera.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Chimera</span></span> builds should plan with this in mind and be careful about taking even 3 mutations that hunger for ranks as you'll want to gain as many mutations as possible to grow limbs.

As far as actually spending mutation points goes, rank up your mutations that get your build online first and once they're strong or can't rank up anymore, your supporting mutations can then get ranks. Rapid advancements should be placed in mutations that gain real benefit from going past 10; which is typically going to be your core mutation that your build centers around.

For example, I may have a build that combines the tankiness of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Carapace</span></span> with the damage of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Corrosive Gas Generation</span></span> with the safety and utility of <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Wings.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Wings</span></span>.</span> I would rapidly advance <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Carapace</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Corrosive Gas Generation</span></span> since these hunger for ranks more and really benefit from going past 10, while <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Wings.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Wings</span></span> can sit at 6. I might rank <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Wings.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Wings</span></span> to 6 first though because it needs to hit that threshold to meet its role in the build, and then evenly distribute mutation points between <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Carapace</span></span> and <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Corrosive Gas Generation</span></span>.</span>

## Armor Value and Dodge Value

While any build can use pretty much any equipment in the game and by extension get any <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> they want, some builds are better equipped going a particular route. Even further than that, whether you choose to focus on <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> largely comes down to your playstyle and how you prefer to play the game. I'll be breaking down each of these and explaining what exactly they do and the idea behind increasing one or the other.

### Armor Value (AV)

<span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> is the more reliable stat of the two and is much less polarizing than <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>.</span> That is to say, there are grades of effectiveness to <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> and it will be very reliable within its grade. Whenever you are hit by an attack, the game will calculate whether or not that attack penetrates your armor and therefore deals damage. The calculation for this is rather complex, so I won't be covering it in all of its detail here but I'll give the simplified version. Essentially, the greater the weapons Penetration Value <span class="nowrap">(<span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span>)</span> is compared to your <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>,</span> the higher chance it will penetrate. When a weapon penetrates, it deals its damage and any on-penetrate effects. The game then reduces the <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> of the weapon and then checks if it penetrates again. If it does, the weapon deals its damage again and then reduces the <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> and cycles in this way until the weapon doesn't penetrate. This is why you may see those x4 or x5 numbers by the damage dealt in the chat log; this refers to the number of penetrations that occurred. As you may imagine, we want the number of penetrations to be as few as possible and that's what <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> is all about.

By having higher <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>,</span> you reduce the effectiveness of each hit when you get hit. With very high <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>,</span> you can reliably take no damage at all from nearly any attack. A good rule of thumb is to have 2 higher <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> than the enemy has <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span>.</span> The math works out to where you will usually only take a single penetration and rarely a second. Even having equal <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> to the enemy's <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> is quite good, but does result in a fairly common (50%) chance of a second penetration.

<span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> comes at a cost, however. Most equipment that raises <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> will actively decrease <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>.</span> There is a lot to be said about a build that sacrifices all attempts at increasing <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> and instead just focuses on <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>.</span> These builds tend to be very survivable until they meet a counter to <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>,</span> but that's not to say they're building wrong. In fact, if you use even a single item that reduces <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>,</span> unless you really know what you're doing around these stats you'll probably just want to entirely focus on <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>.</span> There are exceptions of course, but we'll talk more about that in the <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> section.

While having high <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> can potentially net you invulnerability to _conventional_ attacks, not all attacks are conventional. It is these scenarios where your defenses will be tested.

#### Counters to AV

-   Elemental damage (oozes)
-   Explosions (robots)
-   Vibro weapons <span class="nowrap">(<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Sawhander.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="W">saw-hander</span></span></span></span>,</span> <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ickslug.png" /></span><span class="object">ickslugs</span></span>)</span>
-   On-Hit effects (stun)
-   <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Penetrating Strikes.png" /></span><span class="skill">Penetrating Strikes</span></span>

### Dodge Value (DV)

<span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> is less reliable in terms of how absolutely you can rely on it, but is balanced by the fact that when it works, you take no damage at all. You can also get improved <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> in ways outside of your equipment by having higher <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>:</span> you get a <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> bonus equal to your <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> modifier. The good thing about <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> is once you get it high enough, virtually no further improvement to it is beneficial so you can transition to <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> improvements. The bad thing is that number is actually quite high.

How attacks work in Qud is that a random number from 1-20 is rolled. The game will add the attacker's <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> modifier to it and that's usually all that will be added. However, certain skills and weapons will give a bonus to hit and in those cases the bonus will be applied. This is somewhat rare for creatures to have though. That sum will be compared to the defenders <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> and if it exceeds it the attack will hit.

For melee attacks if a 20 is rolled, the attack _will always hit_. Regardless of your <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>,</span> the attack will hit. Only the player's attacks are guaranteed to penetrate on a crit, so we didn't need to worry about that with <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>.</span> However, critical hits are very troublesome for <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> focused builds. We'll put those aside for now, but don't forget it: critical hits are the bane of <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> builds.

Most creatures actually don't have very high <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>.</span> In fact, even most endgame creatures have less than a +5 to their <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>.</span> So having a <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> of 15 or above nets you fairly reliable odds to dodge many attacks. Of course, this is still too low to be a <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> focused build, but it's a good starting place. Our goal for <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> builds is to ensure that nothing hits us ever. Once your <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> reaches 22 or so, you become virtually untouchable. The maximum <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> you should shoot for is 25, as if you also have the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Swift Reflexes.png" /></span><span class="skill">Swift Reflexes</span></span> skill you will become invincible to all projectile attacks. Anything higher than this and you are really hurting yourself with the investment instead of investing into <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>,</span> as melee critical hits will still hit you and without the <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> to withstand them, it will hurt.

Regardless of how high you go into <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>,</span> it is foolish to rely on <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> alone. Eventually, you will be hit and in these scenarios you have to have some kind of <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> in order to not be completely blasted apart. Pure <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> equipment is a trap and only should be worn if you have sufficient <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> already. You'll want to get around 8 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> as soon as possible as this is a fairly decent middling <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> that will allow you to take the occasional hit when it comes. As long as you otherwise maximize your <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>,</span> 8 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> is actually a fairly comfortable place to be for most of the game. Some items will reduce your <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> and give you <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>.</span> Pay special attention to these as if your build focuses on <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>,</span> many of these will be too crippling. It is only when you arrive at the flawless crysteel tier of armors that the <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> decrease does not outweigh the <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> increase (there's a compelling argument for simple crysteel, but leave that for the more advanced builds). Even then, you want to ensure you still have enough <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> for your build to function so limit this to only a few pieces of armor.

Critical hits are the obvious bane for a <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> build. However, it's not the only one. There are a number of dangers that you must absolutely have a solution for when they appear. Note that even though there are more items in this list, these typically are far easier to have solutions for or are far rarer than those than counter <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>.</span>

## Build Conclusions

Any build can be effective in the game, this is something that I've spent many hours trying to verify myself. After raising every preset mutant to be capable of running the cherubim gauntlet and beating the game without using any equipment at all, I truly am satisfied that the conclusion is that any build can be successful.

Certain builds will of course be more powerful than others, but determining which build is the **most** powerful is not going to help you improve. The best build to beat the game with is one that you understand how to use and understand the limitations of. Keep it simple at the start and as you learn more about the game you can branch to more and more specialized builds.
