# Cybernetics

---

For the true kin enjoyers out there, we'll take a look at the available cybernetics. Here's the deal about cybernetics: by their very nature, they are _meant_ to be swapped out and upgraded over time. This makes it difficult to give a specific rating like I did for mutations as most cybernetics are not meant for your final build. So we'll actually start off by giving some analysis to your cybernetic progression throughout the game.

## Credit Wedges Throughout the Game

Which cybernetics you get are largely random, so we need to talk about the more guaranteed mode of progression which are the <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/CyberneticsCreditWedge.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="C">cybernetics credit wedges</span></span></span></span>.</span> A true kin's progression is gated by both of those, so throughout this analysis I will simply assume you get lucky and have whichever particular cybernetic we're looking at. I'll start by analyzing the amount of credit wedges and therefore license points you should have available at a given point in time.

### Tier 1 : Red Rock (Level 1-10)

<div class="section-info">

**New Credits:** 3

**License Tier:** 5

</div>

In this section of the game, you're still very limited not only in the cybernetics available to you, but also in your license tier. You start with a license tier of 2 and can increase it typically only to 5 at this point in the game, and your cybernetics will be limited to whatever you find at the bottom of the Rusted Archway, your starting cybernetic and anything you find from <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Argyve.png" /></span><span class="object">Argyve</span></span>.</span> You can find 1 credit wedge on the mummified body in the waterlogged tunnels between Joppa and Red Rock and a 2 credit wedge at the bottom of the Rusted Archway.

### Tier 2 : Grit Gate (Level 10-18)

<div class="section-info">

**New Credits:** 7

**License Tier:** 10

</div>

This is the first point of the game where you'll start getting access to historic sites which will be one of the primary ways you gain credit wedges throughout the game aside from your guaranteed credit wedges. Whether or not you get access to all of the theoretically accessible historic sites is more or less down to random chance, but over the many runs I've done I'll consider the average amount of historic sites that I usually get by these points of the game. For example, in this section it is fairly rare to get another low tier accessible historic site besides the guaranteed one from the statue north of Joppa. So aside from the 2 credit wedge from this historic site, you can also find 4 credit wedge at the bottom of Golgotha and 1 credit wedge purchaseable from Q-Girl at Grit Gate.

### Tier 3 : Bethesda Susa (Level 18-26)

<div class="section-info">

**New Credits:** 15

**License Tier:** 17

</div>

You can get 6 credit wedges from Bethesda Susa, 2 credit wedges from the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Wild Water Merchant.png" /></span><span class="object">wild-eyed water merchant</span></span> outside of Mamon Souldrinker's lair (you can just kill him for it), 3 credit wedges from a jungle tier historic site and 4 credit wedges from a river / mountain / rainbow wood / banana grove tier site. Obviously, you can potentially get more depending on your luck with historic sites here, and perhaps you've been very lucky and found a credit wedge or two as random loot around the world. You've potentially killed a legendary Putus Templar for an extra 3 credit wedges.

### Tier 4 : Endgame (Level 26-35)

<div class="section-info">

**New Credits:** 45

**License Tier:** 30

</div>

You get an absolutely **immense** amount of guaranteed credits wedges here as well as access to pretty much the rest of the historic sites. 3 credit wedges purchaseable from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Yla Haj.png" /></span><span class="object">Yla Haj</span></span> in Ezra, 6 credit wedges purchaseable from Warden <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Une.png" /></span><span class="object">Une</span></span> in the Yd Freehold, 3 credit wedges from the Rainbow Wood body, 6 credit wedges in the crematory of the Tomb of the Eaters, 4 credit wedges from Gyl, 4 credit wedges from the Hydropon, 3 credit wedges from the legendary templar attacking Grit Gate, 6 credit wedges from the top of the roaming keter of Chavvah and likely around 16 credit wedges from historic sites. You've likely actually got more by this point as you've likely found multiple legendary Templar in the world with more credit wedges.

### Tier 5 : Post-Game (Level 35+)

The sky is the limit here, you've likely got even more than the anticipated number even in the prior section, so in the post game you're just cleaning up any historic sites you've missed and finding loose credit wedges in the world from legendary templar.

Cybernetics are quite flexible in where you can place them, so in order to analyze them properly you need to consider what you're **not** getting by using a given cybernetic in a slot. I'll first cover cybernetics that can only be installed in a single slot and then consider cybernetics with flexible positions. For each of these, I'll give a very general rating which considers whether the cybernetic is a competitive choice in most scenarios for most builds. Basically every cybernetic is useful somehow in some context or for some reason, so this doesn't necessarily mean the cybernetic is not redeemable or you should never use it.

Additionally, keep in mind that if you have the points to spare, _some_ cybernetic is always better than _no_ cybernetic. Unless the cybernetic is permanent, just try it out as even the lower rated cybernetics do have redeeming qualities (just not as good as what you'd have to give up for it).

## Cybernetics - Head Only

### Skillsoft [low sp]

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 1

**Useful Through:** Tier 1

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-down"><input-icon variant="thumbDown"></input-icon></span>

</div>

This cybernetic will only give you a single skill that costs from 1-50 skill points. Since it's taking up our head slot to do this, you really want something good and true kin don't hunger for skill points anyways as they get increased skill points in comparison to mutants. If you have nothing to put here, go ahead but just know that possession of that skill is fleeting and if you really want it you'll probably have to buy it normally at some point.

### Skillsoft [medium sp]

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 2

**Useful Through:** Tier 2

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-down"><input-icon variant="thumbDown"></input-icon></span>

</div>

Gives a single skill that costs from 51-150 skill points. Definitely better than <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SingleSkillsoft1.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">skillsoft</span></span></span></span> <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">[low sp]</span></span>,</span> but highly dependent on _which_ specific skill you get access to. The fact that it also costs your head slot means you probably are just using this if you get a lucky skill that you don't want to have to buy yet and you have a free head slot.

### Inflatable Axons

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 2

**Useful Through:** Tier 4

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-up"><input-icon variant="thumbUp"></input-icon></span>

</div>

This cybernetic will give you +40 quickness for 10 rounds then -10 quickness for 10 rounds. This then goes on cooldown for 100 turns (before <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower">Willpower</span></span> reduction). Let's analyze more specifically what that means:

With +40 quickness, you will get an extra round of actions after the 3rd, 5th, 8th, and 10th rounds. You then lose an action on the 20th round. If our combat goes for 20 rounds, this results in 3 net extra turns and 4 net extra turns if our combat goes less than 20 rounds. This can be quite good; even moreso if you happen to have good compute power as the bonus and the duration both scale with enhanced compute power. It's not permanent, so as long as you use this carefully and not haphazardly, it may be that special sauce you need to take down a more powerful creature. However, if your build doesn't have very impressive damage or already has good ways of dealing with lone powerful threats, 3-4 extra turns may not be worth very much in the grand scheme of things. In these instances, you'll want something with more tangible effects.

I would be remiss to leave things there, as this benefits from compute power in a major way. It increases _both_ the quickness boost and the duration, meaning at higher tiers you can keep it on pretty much indefinitely. This is one cybernetic that can be built around, and does a pretty good job at being built around at the cost of not being obvious that you can do so.

### Nocturnal Apex

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 2

**Useful Through:** Tier 2

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-down"><input-icon variant="thumbDown"></input-icon></span>

</div>

With Nocturnal Apex, we get a different buff depending on the time of day. If it's daytime, we get a pitiful 10% healing rate increase. During the night, we get a one-time use of <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/CommandToggleNocturnalApex.png" /></span><span class="skill">Prowl</span></span>,</span> which gives us 6 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> and 10 movespeed but only for 100 rounds. 10 movespeed is really nothing special; especially for a one time use and even moreso for only 100 rounds during the night. 6 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> is an OK buff, but all that's really doing is giving us +3 <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>.</span> This is a good bit, but it's so conditional and temporary that most of the time you're going to want something else in this slot.

### Reactive Cranial Plating

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 2

**Useful Through:** Tier 5

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-up"><input-icon variant="thumbUp"></input-icon></span>

</div>

Immunity to stun and daze? Yes, please! This is an unbelievably good cybernetic for high <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> builds as a large number of creatures use cudgels and getting stunned by one will reduce your <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> and cause you to be absolutely torn apart. If your build rarely if ever comes into melee contact with anything, perhaps you'll miss out on this one in favor of other cybernetics that improve your escape tools or ranged fighting. However, if you do a large amount of melee fighting this cybernetic is fantastic and common and can easily sit on you for the entirety of the game.

### Schemasoft [low-tier]

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 2

**Useful Through:** Tier 2

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-down"><input-icon variant="thumbDown"></input-icon></span>

</div>

The problem with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Schemasoft2.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">Schemasoft</span></span></span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="Y">[low-tier]</span></span> is that although it will give access to _every_ <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker I.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span> recipe of a specific type, it does not give access to any mods. Because that's really the whole point of <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker I.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span>,</span> this is not that great. You'll outgrow this pretty quickly, but if you've got nothing else you may find something useful in there if you get Grenades since you _do_ get access to some still pretty strong mk III grenades like freeze and high explosive.

### Schemasoft [mid-tier]

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 3

**Useful Through:** Tier 3

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-down"><input-icon variant="thumbDown"></input-icon></span>

</div>

While most classes of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Schemasoft2.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">Schemasoft</span></span></span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="Y">[mid-tier]</span></span> aren't super great, the rifle and utility categories can be quite good; especially the utility as that's the main reason to get <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker II.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinker II</span></span> in the first place. The other categories are pretty lackluster as they don't really have much going for them. Just as an example, the tonics category just gives access to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/NectarTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">E</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="M">t</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="Y">r</span><span class="Y">s</span><span class="Y">'</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="W">n</span><span class="w">e</span><span class="g">c</span><span class="G">t</span><span class="W">a</span><span class="w">r</span></span> injectors</span></span> and <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SphynxSaltTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="C">s</span><span class="c">p</span><span class="m">h</span><span class="M">y</span><span class="C">n</span><span class="c">x</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="Y">salt</span></span> injectors</span></span>.</span> Pretty underwhelming considering how rare their components are. Of course, this cybernetic becomes obsolete the moment you find the normal <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/DataDisk.png" /></span><span class="object">data disks</span></span> for the artifacts you really want to use, but if you've got the space until then this is a pretty decent choice.

### Skillsoft [high sp]

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 3

**Useful Through:** Tier 4

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-down"><input-icon variant="thumbDown"></input-icon></span>

</div>

There's not too many skills that cost above 151 skill points, and most of them are pretty good. Of course, not _all_ of them are good for your build <span class="nowrap">(<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Berserk!.png" /></span><span class="skill">Berserk!</span></span></span> as a long blades user? Snooze). If you do happen to get a good one, especially something like <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Mastery.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weapon Mastery</span></span> without having purchased <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Expertise.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weapon Expertise</span></span>,</span> it _may_ just be worth eating up the head slot for. Again, it'll likely skill be conditional as it'll just be a matter of time before you just have the skill points to spend on it anyway and can swap this out for something more meaningful.

### Dopamine Synth

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 3

**Useful Through:** Tier 4

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-down"><input-icon variant="thumbDown"></input-icon></span>

</div>

This just gives you 2 <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower">Willpower</span></span>.</span> Don't get me wrong, <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower">Willpower</span></span> is great. But is it worth a head slot? Not really. Getting your cooldowns to be a couple turns faster _could_ be beneficial in some niche scenarios, but it's far more likely that something else you can put here will be more useful more often.

### Schemasoft [high-tier]

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 4

**Useful Through:** Tier 5

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-down"><input-icon variant="thumbDown"></input-icon></span>

</div>

The big pain point of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker III.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinker III</span></span> is just getting the <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span> necessary to buy it.

Unfortunately since all <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Schemasoft2.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">Schemasoft</span></span></span></span> cybernetics are destroyed upon removal, we do have to make the most out of this once we have it installed. Therefore, you should hold on to one of these if you find a good one (like armor or utility) until you have the bits to make what you want, and then craft any artifacts you want to have. Uninstall after you're done. Should you just walk around with it installed? Probably not.

### Social Coprocessor

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 8

**Useful Through:** Tier 5

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-up"><input-icon variant="thumbUp"></input-icon></span>

</div>

This cybernetic does quite a lot. First, you gain an extra 25 reputation for water ritual, just like the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tactful.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tactful</span></span> skill (but this stacks with <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tactful.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tactful</span></span>)</span>. It will reduce the amount of reputation you have to pay by 20% for rewards through water ritual (join cost, secret cost, learning skill cost, etc). Finally, you are able to use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Proselytize.png" /></span><span class="skill">Proselytize</span></span> on an additional creature. This cybernetic is designed for pretty much the sole purpose of creating an army. If that's your vibe, then go for it; it'll be pretty good. It's a hefty cost, but definitely worth it as you find yourself surrounded by allies that rip apart the few factions still hostile to you. Personally, I find the army playstyle boring so while I'll be giving this a pass, it can be quite good.

### Skillsoft Plus

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 3-15

**Useful Through:** Tier 4

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-down"><input-icon variant="thumbDown"></input-icon></span>

</div>

This cybernetic is in a strange place. You get all the skills from a particular skill tree, but the cost changes depending on which tree that is with the more useful ones costing the most. The problem is that anything useful is probably going to cost 9+ license points, and that's a tough one to slot in for a large portion of the game. Just like the normal <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SingleSkillsoft1.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">skillsoft</span></span></span></span> cybernetics, as true kin we're really not hurting for skill points so you're probably best just leaving this one uninstalled. I will mention, however, that if you get <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span> as your tree, you can use this in the same way as <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Schemasoft2.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">Schemasoft</span></span></span></span> <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">[high-tier]</span></span>,</span> just better.

## Cybernetics - Face Only

### Cherubic Visage

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 1

**Useful Through:** Tier 2

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-down"><input-icon variant="thumbDown"></input-icon></span>

</div>

If you happen to pick this up before you get something that can go in your face slot, it's only 1 license point for +1 <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span>.</span> Not too bad, but since true kin aren't using any mental mutations, 1 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> is not really impactful. Swap it out once you get something better.

Something to note is that in the late game, many true kin acquire mutations via <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Gamma Moth.png" /></span><span class="object">gamma moths</span></span> or <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="g">b</span><span class="g">r</span><span class="g">a</span><span class="w">i</span><span class="W">n</span><span class="W"> </span><span class="W">b</span><span class="w">r</span><span class="g">i</span><span class="g">n</span><span class="g">e</span></span>.</span> Mental mutations will benefit from <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> and thus this becomes more useful, but if you're capable of this and trying to gain mental mutation ranks, you're just as capable to farm for <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/NectarTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">E</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="M">t</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="Y">r</span><span class="Y">s</span><span class="Y">'</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="W">n</span><span class="w">e</span><span class="g">c</span><span class="G">t</span><span class="W">a</span><span class="w">r</span></span> injectors</span></span> and using a better cybernetic.

### Optical Bioscanner

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 1

**Useful Through:** Tier 2

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-down"><input-icon variant="thumbDown"></input-icon></span>

</div>

This gives you precise knowledge of the durability of your target; as long as it's biological. This is a cybernetic that becomes less and less useful the more experience you have with the game. It can be handy while you're still learning the game to notify you of a creature out of your league or when a creature is near death, but once you get a few games under your belt you'll be able to know this information without the cybernetic as the health description becomes plenty for you. It has its niche especially with creatures with lots of <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span><span class="stat">HP</span></span> to know if you just need one more attack or should heal, but by that point in the game there are better options you'll likely have to do the same. This cybernetic can also be replicated by the <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Bio-Scanning Bracelet.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="g">b</span><span class="G">i</span><span class="W">o</span><span class="M">-</span><span class="W">s</span><span class="G">c</span><span class="g">a</span><span class="g">n</span><span class="g">n</span><span class="g">i</span><span class="g">n</span><span class="g">g</span></span> bracelet</span></span>,</span> so if you get one of those this becomes pretty obsolete as it takes up our face cybernetic.

### Optical Technoscanner

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 1

**Useful Through:** Tier 4

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-up"><input-icon variant="thumbUp"></input-icon></span>

</div>

Techscanning is typically much more useful than bioscanning because while it only gives us the readout of robots, we also automatically identify all artifacts. This includes artifacts in a merchant's inventory, so it becomes very important for us to make sure we're spending our drams on artifacts we actually want instead of making an educated guess based off the cost and weight of the artifact. Of course, once we get a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Telemetric Visor.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="K">t</span><span class="y">e</span><span class="c">l</span><span class="C">e</span><span class="Y">m</span><span class="W">e</span><span class="C">t</span><span class="c">r</span><span class="y">i</span><span class="K">c</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="C">visor</span></span></span></span> this no longer becomes useful but in the meantime, it can be pretty darn convenient. There's some better stuff that can go here eventually, but this is pretty good if you've got the slot empty.

### Night Vision

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 2

**Useful Through:** Tier 3

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-up"><input-icon variant="thumbUp"></input-icon></span>

</div>

The vision granted here is the same as the <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Night-vision Goggles.png" /></span><span class="object">night-vision goggles</span></span>,</span> and will have the same effect. Do yourself a favor and turn off the green effect from this, because if you don't this becomes pretty bad since (at least to me) color is a pretty big part of properly identifying enemies or at least identifying enemies quickly. Early on, you're not going to have anything good here and keeping your hands free to use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> or two-handed weapon builds is pretty handy since we don't have any options to get more arms until we find the rare helping hands.

This cybernetic provides a **massive** vision range, but as soon as you have a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Floating Glowsphere.png" /></span><span class="object">floating <span class="injected"><span class="Y">glowsphere</span></span></span></span> the effect is _close enough_ that you can reasonably swap it out with something else for your face slot. This slot tends to be more utility anyways, and this is a pretty decent one. You're likely to eventually swap it out, but it's pretty good in the meantime.

300 reputation is really quite good; it's enough to put nearly any faction to neutrality with you; certainly any of the factions that you'd be interested in actively improving faction relations can be made neutral with this cybernetic. Of course, this only remains good while you don't naturally have good reputation with the given faction, which you will eventually want to do. Like other cybernetics that are destroyed upon removal, this is _good_ but you probably don't want it as a _permanent_ installation; just as a holdover until you can gain the reputation naturally or find something you want more.

+200 reputation to a faction of your choice at will is a pretty good benefit, but it does come at the cost of being restricted to the competitive face slot. 200 reputation is unfortunately just large enough to _sound_ really good and just small enough to be _just_ not enough for really anything useful on its own. You'll have to have at least a small bump in reputation in order for the rep to be meaningful and often times if you've been careful with your rep by the point you can afford (or even find) the <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/HolographicVisage.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">holographic visage</span></span></span></span>,</span> you probably just don't need it. If you've got something in mind, definitely keep it around in case as it 100% has its niche uses but this one probably won't make up your serious loadout.

This combines both the bioscanner and technoscanner in one with some added benefits. It also includes structural scanning (which, admittedly, you probably will never care about) and most notably it will also detect any staircases on the current zone. If it just combined all the scanning, you might as well just use the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/TechnologicalIndexer.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">optical technoscanner</span></span></span></span> as that's by far the most useful one. However, since this also includes the staircase display, that pushes it over the edge to being worth the cost and the face slot. It's quite expensive, but if you happen to find one it's definitely a great addition to have.

We've got +2 <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness">Toughness</span></span>,</span> which will give us bonus hitpoints equal to 2 x Level and since cybernetics boost your base level of stat, this can be used for any skill requirements.

It doesn't prevent fungal infections, and the only real place you're going to be getting diseases (if you get any at all) is going to be at Golgotha. It'll also give you immunity to poison, but poison is a very uncommon damage type that just gets less and less common as the game goes on. If you find this pre-Golgotha, it's going to be one of the only cybernetics that you'll even be able to install, but it will likely be worth it for that dungeon. Additionally, the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Irisdual Beam.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Irisdual Beam</span></span> of Nephilim is 1 part poison damage, so if you want to try and take as little damage as possible from that then slot this in (there are other ways to negate poison damage without this though). Other than that, body cybernetics are just far too competitive.

### Equipment Rack

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-up"><input-icon variant="thumbUp"></input-icon></span>

</div>

At the cost of a body cybernetic slot, we gain another back slot. It won't give us another back _cybernetic_ slot, but we can equip another piece of back equipment. If you wear back equipment solely for the armor bonus, most high tier back items that provide these good bonuses also provide other bonuses that you'll benefit from stacking two of.

This goes without saying that if you use back equipment that _doesn't_ provide armor bonuses, you get even more benefit from this cybernetic as you can now use two of them and get even better bonuses. It also synergizes naturally with cybernetics like <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/GunRack.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">gun rack</span></span></span></span> and the cathedras which occupy the back slot because it gives you another back slot to use normal back equipment with. However, if you only use back equipment solely for the armor bonus, there are occasions where they don't give that benefit (especially early game back items). In these cases, you're not getting much benefit so use a different cybernetic but definitely hold on to this one.

One particularly powerful use of this cybernetic is using two pairs of helping hands in order to obtain 6 limbs and using all <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> skills. These robotic hands benefit from this skill tree, and you can quickly become a devastating flurry of weapons.

It'll teleport you to a random explored tile. You don't get to choose which one, and if there are dangerous liquids on the map, you can be teleported there. You can also be teleported to a _worse_ location that your current one, so while it can _usually_ work as a getaway tool, it's not reliable enough to use in all scenarios and has a pretty considerable cooldown.

For quite a large portion of the game, this is just not very useful in general. It's only when you get items that you want to magnetize that this starts to improve, like magnetizing psychodine helmets or guns, and these are only going to be happening in the end game. It will also give you access to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Chiral Rings.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="B">c</span><span class="b">h</span><span class="c">i</span><span class="C">r</span><span class="M">a</span><span class="m">l</span><span class="k"> </span><span class="m">r</span><span class="M">i</span><span class="C">n</span><span class="c">g</span><span class="b">s</span></span></span></span> as long as you have gone to Brightsheol.

This cybernetic will save you from death or from 50% damage once and then be permanently destroyed. This means that you are making yourself weaker for you to eventually be saved from a single hit. The problem is that if you're taking 50% of your <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span><span class="stat">HP</span></span> in a single hit or you're taking lethal damage, saving yourself from that only 1 time likely is **not** enough. This also will not prevent instant death from sources that ignore <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span><span class="stat">HP</span></span>,</span> like coming into phase in a wall or by drinking <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="B">n</span><span class="b">e</span><span class="K">u</span><span class="y">t</span><span class="Y">r</span><span class="B">o</span><span class="b">n</span><span class="K"> </span><span class="y">f</span><span class="Y">l</span><span class="B">u</span><span class="b">x</span></span>.</span>

These are very rare to begin with, so give this one a pass. There is a niche this cybernetic has with extreme <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> builds where it can actually come in handy in saving you from an errant crit, but if your build is that full of holes already you probably have bigger problems than what body slot cybernetic to use.

This cybernetic makes true kin easily able to abuse artifacts and solves the biggest problem with multi energy-gun builds which is the immense amount of power you need to supply them.

The big caveat here is that if you _don't_ have any jacked equipment and/or you don't like <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span> in general, then this is a literally useless cybernetic.

Shooting through walls is mega cool, although you are giving up the ability to shoot many guns at once. If this was looked at in a vacuum, it'd be pretty good as long as you could pair it with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Night-Sight Interpolators.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="K">night-sight</span></span> interpolators</span></span> or <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/PenetratingRadar.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">penetrating radar</span></span></span></span>.</span> Without that, you can't really utilize it but you're going to want those anyways. But not only does this cybernetic _require_ assistance from other tools, you're giving up <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/GunRack.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">gun rack</span></span></span></span> or a cathedra in order to use this, which are both better in isolation.

This cybernetic does have the capability to hit creatures in any phase, which does have some synergies with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/ShadeOilTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="y">s</span><span class="K">h</span><span class="c">a</span><span class="b">d</span><span class="B">e</span><span class="y"> </span><span class="C">o</span><span class="y">i</span><span class="K">l</span></span> injectors</span></span> and phase silk cooking. The rough patch is that it doesn't do anything that the phase harmonic / phase conjugate mod don't already do for you. If you don't have those mods and it's integral for your build that you hit things out-of-phase, then this will help.

The rub with this one is if you can get <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/PenetratingRadar.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">penetrating radar</span></span></span></span> with a healthy amount of compute power, your sight can reach so far that you can snipe down enemies from all over the map without them being able to reach you. If you happen to have that ideal setup, then it's amazing. It's something to hold onto for an "ideal state" build, but until then you've probably got a stronger option.

You start to run into diminishing returns when you use up those floating nearby slots, so I'd recommend saving those equipment.

### Cathedra

Cathedra come in 4 flavors: black opal, sapphire, ruby, and white opal. Sapphire gives you access to an ability similar to <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Stunning Force.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stunning Force</span></span>,</span> white opal grants a burst of glitter that reflects light-based attacks, ruby generates a heat field like <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Pyrokinesis.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Pyrokinesis</span></span>,</span> but larger, longer lasting and centered on you, and black opal just teleports you to a random spot in Qud. Ruby and sapphire are by far and away the better activated effects, but all cathedra have the same general effects.

All cathedra give 100 carrying capacity, 100 move speed, 50 <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span><span class="stat">HP</span></span>,</span> 3 <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span>,</span> and perfect <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandFlyToggle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Flight</span></span>.</span> The <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandFlyToggle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Flight</span></span> level, 100 turn cooldown and power of the ability are all benefitted from compute power as well. For ruby and sapphire tracery cathedra, just the activated ability is well worth the back equipment slot and the back cybernetic slot, and these general bonuses are just the sugar on top. White and black opal tracery are comparatively not as great and potentially not worth the cost.

The benefit to cathedra is hidden in the movement speed bonus. Movement speed bonuses to true kin are usually much smaller as the only significant cybernetics that provide movement speed are the cathedra and the <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/MotorizedTreads.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">motorized treads</span></span></span></span>.</span> The <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/MotorizedTreads.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">motorized treads</span></span></span></span> cause you to be immune to <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="K">i</span><span class="y">r</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="y">n</span><span class="K">s</span><span class="y">h</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="y">n</span><span class="K">k</span></span>,</span> but cathedra do not. This allows us to sacrifice 80 movement speed in exchange for 5 <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>,</span> which makes cathedra fantastic for both ranged and melee builds since ranged builds can use it to increase their gap while melee builds can use it to increase their durability. Cathedra can also be used in combination with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/MotorizedTreads.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">motorized treads</span></span></span></span> to give you extreme levels of movement speed.

Unfortunately for the cathedra, not only are they unbelievably rare, but they are also a permanent decision that requires an extreme amount of license points. If you're at the point in the game where you can afford one or even happen to find one, it can be absolutely fantastic. However, chances are you either don't have one or can't afford it.

So in reality, you're just going to use these for grenades and if that's what you're doing, it's an explosive you don't have to be perfectly accurate. There are niche scenarios where precise grenade throwing is handy to have like tossing grenades past enemies to hit multiple or targeting a specific enemy with a stasis grenade or something. If you've got nothing to go into an arm slot, go ahead; it's cheap and you've got 2 arm slots. Otherwise, give it a miss.

This one is tough to rate properly. It gives an extra throw slot per installation and allows you to throw everything in all throw slots simultaneously. If you're throwing anything, you're probably throwing either a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Geomagnetic Disc.png" /></span><span class="object">geomagnetic disc</span></span> or a grenade.

It's not the amazing damage it once was, but respectable ranged damage to many targets (and if <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="m">morphogenetic</span></span>,</span> extremely good utility). If your build really struggles with many targets, it's a worthwhile investment. For grenades, anything you throw either risks serious damage to yourself or is just overkill.

True kin do not have many great melee cybernetics, so these are a great pickup for melee builds.

Of course, if you don't use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> then this won't help you.

For how early you can get this, it's incredibly good. It allows you to wield any two-handed weapon (melee OR ranged) in a single hand, _no matter where that hand may be_. This means it combines with helping hands and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/GunRack.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">gun rack</span></span></span></span> naturally as you can wield two-handed melee weapons in all 4 of your hands with helping hands and wield rifles in all hands as well. Since <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Akimbo.png" /></span><span class="skill">Akimbo</span></span> shoots all equipped ranged weapons at the same time, that means you can fire _all your held rifles at the same time_.

Two-handed weapons are just obviously far stronger than one-handed weapons, so being able to wield them in one hand just significantly improves your melee damage. The best part about this cybernetic is that it _also_ does so for your ranged damage. Using <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/GiantHands.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">giant hands</span></span></span></span>,</span> you can run powerful melee builds usually reserved for mutants like two-handed weapon and offhand <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> / offhand <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> or use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> with two-handed weapons.

There are some extremely valid builds that don't benefit from this cybernetic at all, however. If your build revolves around <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>,</span> you gain no benefit from this as you already wield those in one hand.

I won't lie to you, there have certainly been scenarios where I have lamented not having this cybernetic. The only reason for that is its ability to let your tinker in combat and that's just because I ran out of grenades. It's other effects are all largely inconsequential, and while I may have wanted to convenience once or twice of being able to craft more grenades to spam at enemies, it's not like I couldn't have just crafted more grenades ahead of time. I was just lazy.

Typically, if you have even average <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span> you will have no difficulty identifying artifacts, so increasing your chance here is not very meaningful. Having a higher chance to recover bits would be pretty handy early when you're bit hungry, but by the time you get this and have the 5 license points to blow without impacting the rest of your build, you'll probably have all the bits you realistically need. Making this better with compute power is pretty snooze as well. You're just weaker for taking this instead of one of the other great options for hands cybernetics.

This does require a significant <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> score and while it can result in some of the highest damage _possible_ in a single hit by a melee weapon, the fact of the matter is that it's just not that necessary.

Additionally, the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/CrysteelHandBones.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">crysteel hand bones</span></span></span></span> will always be outscaled by the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Fist of the Ape God.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="r">Fist</span></span> of the <span class="injected"><span class="Y">Ape God</span></span></span></span> as it will _also_ scale with <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> infinitely and we can one-hand that with <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/GiantHands.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">giant hands</span></span></span></span>,</span> which leaves us room to wield a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> or offhand <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> _and_ allows us to wield double rifles.

Additionally, uncapped <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> only does so much to help you due to the way the penetration formula works. The simple version is this: If your <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> exceeds the enemy <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> by 3 or more, more <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> _does not help you_. So that uncapped <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> will help on those stupidly high <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> enemies, sure, but those enemies are always better beaten in other ways or by using the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Penetrating Strikes.png" /></span><span class="skill">Penetrating Strikes</span></span> skill.

If you for some reason have an unbelievably high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> score to make use of the uncapped <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> before you get access to <span class="injected"><span class="K">flawless <span class="injected"><span class="y">c</span><span class="y">r</span><span class="K">y</span><span class="g">s</span><span class="g">t</span><span class="K">e</span><span class="y">e</span><span class="y">l</span></span></span></span> / <span class="injected"><span class="m">z</span><span class="M">e</span><span class="Y">t</span><span class="C">a</span><span class="c">c</span><span class="c">h</span><span class="C">r</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="M">m</span><span class="m">e</span></span> weaponry / <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Fist of the Ape God.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="r">Fist</span></span> of the <span class="injected"><span class="Y">Ape God</span></span></span></span>,</span> then this can be a good weapon in the meantime.

There's not a ton of creatures that actually make use of electric attacks, so if it was a more prevalent damage type perhaps this would be more useful.

### Motorized Treads

</div>

I will say one thing that needs to be talked about more about this cybernetic is that while it **is** good; it's _very_ good, it's not without significant trade off. We gain +150 movespeed, which is **massive** and we get a large bonus on quite a few types of saves, including saves vs prone which is also huge. With it and especially with a ranged build, we become very maneuverable and slippery. It also protects us from being run down by templar that also have this cybernetic.

Now, about the cost. This is a **permanent** change, so you need to be sure of your build before you install this. You lose the ability to wear normal footgear and can instead only wear <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Tread Guard.png" /></span><span class="object">tread guards</span></span>,</span> which can result in 2 _maximum_ <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> granted when both treads are worn and **no** chance to improve <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>.</span> These are also quite rare to find, and most of the time I've actually had to craft them before I could find a single one. While these _can_ be modded, none of the applicable mods give statistics except for refractive which is not as impressive as spring-loaded and fitted with cleats. To be fair, we already get those benefits from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/MotorizedTreads.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">motorized treads</span></span></span></span> anyway, but the point being here is that we're not getting much more than the bonus movespeed from this cybernetic in the grand scheme of things.

For that movement speed, we have a maximum possible <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> bonus of 2 compared to the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Zetachrome Pumps.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="m">z</span><span class="M">e</span><span class="Y">t</span><span class="C">a</span><span class="c">c</span><span class="c">h</span><span class="C">r</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="M">m</span><span class="m">e</span></span> pumps</span></span> which give 4 <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>.</span> This isn't as significant a cost as a true kin, as we can use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SphynxSaltTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="C">s</span><span class="c">p</span><span class="m">h</span><span class="M">y</span><span class="C">n</span><span class="c">x</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="Y">salt</span></span> injector</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Precognition</span></span> in order to consume <span class="injected"><span class="B">n</span><span class="b">e</span><span class="K">u</span><span class="y">t</span><span class="Y">r</span><span class="B">o</span><span class="b">n</span><span class="K"> </span><span class="y">f</span><span class="Y">l</span><span class="B">u</span><span class="b">x</span></span> safely and get our <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> up that way, but we're still going to be slightly behind in <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> in full gear compared to a true kin that does not get the <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/MotorizedTreads.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">motorized treads</span></span></span></span>.</span> To be clear, this trade off is still usually worth it, especially for ranged builds.

The trade offs unfortunately don't end there. We are also prevented from wearing <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Anti-Gravity Boots.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="K">anti-gravity boots</span></span></span></span>,</span> which means our only chance for perfect <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandFlyToggle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Flight</span></span> as a true kin is relegated to the ultra-rare and very costly cathedra. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandFlyToggle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Flight</span></span> is an extremely powerful ability, but it becomes significantly less powerful when the chance to fall is present, like in the non-footgear <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandFlyToggle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Flight</span></span> options.

The final trade off is that if we get improved movement speed in another way and want to sacrifice 80 movespeed for the 5 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> of <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="K">i</span><span class="y">r</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="y">n</span><span class="K">s</span><span class="y">h</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="y">n</span><span class="K">k</span></span>,</span> well we actually can no longer contract <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="K">i</span><span class="y">r</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="y">n</span><span class="K">s</span><span class="y">h</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="y">n</span><span class="K">k</span></span>.</span> Motorized treads completely removes your legs, and if you have no legs you can't actually contract <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="K">i</span><span class="y">r</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="y">n</span><span class="K">s</span><span class="y">h</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="y">n</span><span class="K">k</span></span>.</span> In some cases, this is good but if we wanted that trade we actually can no longer make it once we install <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/MotorizedTreads.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">motorized treads</span></span></span></span>.</span>

All-in-all, it _still_ tends to be worth it to make the installation, especially as mentioned before if you are a ranged build. For melee builds, it will be less worthwhile as you'll probably hunger for those <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> bonuses you're missing out on and you can compensate for being slower quite easily by equipping <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Pentaceps.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">pentaceps</span></span></span></span> instead.

The AI around the tonics isn't _that_ great, and if you know your build well situations like automatically popping a salve at 50% <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span><span class="stat">HP</span></span> can just be completely unnecessary. The reduced cost of applying injectors is quite nice if you've really flubbed combat, but the problem with this one is the better you get at the game the less scenarios this even becomes useful in.

If you're still learning the game and constantly die with injectors available, this can be a great tool to keep your runs going and will also cover for situations where you get locked down with stun or sleep and can't apply any healing until it's too late. Once you get more comfortable with the game, you'll find less and less use for this and will swap it to something that makes you more powerful.

A 6% reduction in heat, cold, electric and acid damage is actually very negligible. Especially considering what you're giving up in order to install this, you won't notice the difference that this makes. Most sources of this kind of damage do maximum around 20 damage, so this is giving us 1.2 damage of resistance.

It's pretty rare that you'll ever catch fire outside of very specific areas of the map, and if you're really worried about it you might as well just carry a bit of gel yourself and soak yourself ahead of time rather than install this cybernetic as you can get some better stuff for sure. However, if you've got nothing else then why not.

As the game continues and single points of <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> become less and less significant, we'll want to replace this with more impactful options but it'll be handy in the meantime before we get some better options.

### Palladium Electrodeposits

Now, what improves with compute power? Since cybernetics are not that easy to swap out on a whim, we're interested in including them as part of our build. Here are the relevant cybernetics and items that you'll likely be interested in improving:

-   Cathedra

-   <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Point-Defense Drone.png" /></span><span class="object">Point-defense drone</span></span>

Each <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/PalladiumElectrodeposits.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">palladium electrodeposits</span></span></span></span> will improve these by 20%. None of these items or cybernetics are really so good that we would want to give up one or more cybernetic slots in order to improve them this small amount. If you happen to have one and you also have a free slot for the <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/PalladiumElectrodeposits.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">palladium electrodeposits</span></span></span></span>,</span> it's worth installing just for the bonus. If not, you should be able to find something better.

### Precision Force Lathe

This cybernetic replaces any empty hand and thrown weapon slots with force knives, which are vibro weapons with a d8 damage die. It can slot into the head slot, which is basically dominated by <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/ReactiveCranialPlating.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">reactive cranial plating</span></span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/InflatableAxons.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">inflatable axons</span></span></span></span> so if you're not finding those useful there's a place for this. The problem is what you get; the force knives are just outpaced by other equipment.

The melee attack is outpaced by the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Ceremonial Khopesh.png" /></span><span class="object">ceremonial vibrokhopesh</span></span> and the thrown attack is outpaced by the <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Geomagnetic Disc.png" /></span><span class="object">geomagnetic disc</span></span>.</span> However, these are fairly rare items to find, especially in bulk. If you're able to find this cybernetic early and a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/GraftedMirrorArm.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">grafted mirror arm</span></span></span></span> or two, this cybernetic can definitely be worth your while if you're going with a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> build. It's fun and thematic, but when it comes to the numbers it's a lot to give up for not enough.

It frees up your arm equipment slot and you likely have more to put there than you do cybernetics to install, so it's a nice early option. It's very flexible, so you probably have one applicable slot for it to go into. It's not going to be a part of your end build, but in the meantime it's pretty convenient.

### Stasis Projector

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 6

**Available Slots:** Back, Body, Arm, Head, Hands

**Useful Through:** Tier 5

**General Rating:** <span class="icon-container thumb-up"><input-icon variant="thumbUp"></input-icon></span>

</div>

Due to the flexibility of this cybernetic, you can usually slot it in without too much issue. The 6 generated stasis fields only last for 5 rounds, but because we have control over where we place these fields, we can use it as a pretty good defensive tool in order to escape from enemies or even as an offensive tool to hold enemies in place for us to catch up to them. We can also use this in order to level the playing field for a few rounds if we're facing multiple enemies.

While this cybernetic isn't the _best_ defensive tool available, it's one of the best in such a flexible position. Depending on your needs in this area, you may skip this cybernetic for more power; especially if you have defensive tools already like the <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/HighFidelityMatterRecompositer.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">high-fidelity matter recompositer</span></span></span></span>.</span>

We get a perfect view of every tile within a radius, even through normal obstructions. Because of this, the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/PenetratingRadar.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">penetrating radar</span></span></span></span> fits very well as a face slot cybernetic, given that many cybernetics that can only slot into the face are not as interesting or useful as the <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/PenetratingRadar.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">penetrating radar</span></span></span></span>.</span>

The best part of this cybernetic though is its flexibility. There are so many places to slot in this cybernetic you will surely find a way to fit this cybernetic into your build.

It's pretty rare that robots appear early, and the robots that do appear early can vary greatly.

Since this is such a flexible cybernetic and it only costs 1 license point, it can be handy to have in very early in the game. The moment that robots become a common occurrence this becomes more annoying than useful and will likely be uninstalled.

### Force Modulator

In most cases where this is applicable, this is actually very handy. It also makes you essentially immune to stasis fields, so can even be used in combination with the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/StasisProjector.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">stasis projector</span></span></span></span> cybernetic to put stasis fields on yourself for more escape opportunities. It also is very convenient to ensure you don't get trapped against creatures who are capable of generating forcefields around you such as creatures with the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Wall.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Force Wall</span></span> mutation.

While in most cases going through forcefields is preferable, it's not always preferable to do so. In particular, against creatures with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Force Bubble</span></span> like the <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Chrome Pyramid.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="c">chrome pyramid</span></span></span></span>,</span> you may actually want to be pushed by the bubble instead of going through it to prevent the creature from actually getting within melee range of you.

Whether you want to go through forcefields or not, being required to even make one of these decisions at all is fairly rare as not very many creatures are capable of generating forcefields. Because of this, unless you anticipate needing this capability, you'll likely keep this uninstalled but holding onto this mutation for cases where you need it it a generally good idea.

Perhaps it's just because I've done a lot of mutant runs where rebuking robots isn't an option, but I've never found this ability particularly inspiring in general. It can be handy if you need a way to escape from specifically robots, but we're giving up a whole cybernetic slot just to make this ability a bit better. It does have the benefit of being very flexible, but you definitely would just rather use a defensive tool that works on _all_ creatures and not just robots.

### Phase Harmonic Modulator

Conceptually, this is really cool. Practically, the only creature that you'll reasonably encounter that is phased will be the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Astral Tabby.png" /></span><span class="object">astral tabby</span></span> and that's _always_ phased and can't hit you normally. For you min-maxers that like to collect mutations on true kin, even if you get <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Phasing</span></span> from a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Gamma Moth.png" /></span><span class="object">gamma moth</span></span> or from cooking you won't want this cybernetic because it results in creatures also being able to interact with _you_ as well. Since phase is a non-issue in the normal game, this is just not a useful cybernetic to install.

Normality gas can be kinda handy in some circumstances, but if you really need to puff out some normality you're going to be better suited to just using a normality grenade. You have the added benefit of not necessarily inflicting yourself with normality with the grenade, or you could use a weapon with the nulling mod on it. If you don't have either of these options for Bethesda Susa and want a solution for <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Twinning Lamprey.png" /></span><span class="object">twinning lampreys</span></span>,</span> then sure go for it. Otherwise, you can find something more worthwhile.

### Intravenous Port

The problem with tonics is that the buff they give you is not useful enough for how short they last. Doubling this is unfortunately not enough to really save it for most of the tonics. Even the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SalveTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">salve</span></span> injector</span></span> usually is enough on its own to heal you to full even from very critical health.

The one place where this can be quite handy is with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SphynxSaltTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="C">s</span><span class="c">p</span><span class="m">h</span><span class="M">y</span><span class="C">n</span><span class="c">x</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="Y">salt</span></span> injectors</span></span> as getting double the duration on your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Precognition</span></span> is quite good if you're trying to do some cheesy strats around things like <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Gamma Moth.png" /></span><span class="object">gamma moths</span></span> and RNG manipulation. Otherwise for normal, more intended uses around <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Precognition</span></span> the default duration is sufficient. It may be handy to have a copy of this, but as a permanent member of your cybernetics build you should be able to find something more useful.

### Security Interlock

This is just the less-useful half of <span class="nowrap"><span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Psychometry</span></span>.</span> This is really only useful in Grit Gate, so if you have a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Pickaxe.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="c">pickaxe</span></span></span></span> and patience or have already unlocked all the doors in Grit Gate, this really won't be of any use. Use it once to unlock Grit Gate doors and then uninstall.

### Onboard Recoiler

This cybernetic functions as a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Reprogrammable Recoiler.png" /></span><span class="object">reprogrammable recoiler</span></span> that doesn't consume any charge. This makes it pretty handy as long as you have the space for the cybernetic. If you have the space in your build, this is super nice. If you don't, it's probably not worth sacrificing combat power for. If you have sufficient power cells and the capability of making <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Reprogrammable Recoiler.png" /></span><span class="object">reprogrammable recoilers</span></span> or just have a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Reprogrammable Recoiler.png" /></span><span class="object">reprogrammable recoiler</span></span> in general, then this is also not really useful.
