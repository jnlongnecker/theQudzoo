# Adding a Build Code

---

Build codes are compressed data that represents a build in Caves of Qud. If you know the code that represents a build, you can easily add them into your game. The Qudzoo makes this process super easy, but if you've never done it before it can be a little confusing. Let's dive in!

## Getting the Code

First, you need to have a code to put into the game. Luckily, this is the easiest part! Simply find the build you like, and then click the copy code button to automatically copy the code to your clipboard. You can see a picture of this below:

## Getting it into Qud

Once you have your code, then fire up your copy of Caves of Qud and select the "New Game" option from the title screen. Pick a game mode, it doesn't matter which one but if you want to start a run right away then pick the mode you want to play. When choosing the character type, pick the "Library" option pictured below:

Once you're in the library, select the "Add a new build code" option that's at the end of your library. It will ask you to paste the build code, which should already be on your clipboard if you followed the first step. Paste it in and it will look like this big long ugly string like in the picture:

Click accept, give the build a new name, and now you've got your build loaded up in your Qud library! You can always select it again by going back to your library for a new run, and it won't go away unless you delete it. Enjoy!
