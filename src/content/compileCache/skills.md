# Skills

---

Skills are the unsung hero of Caves of Qud. In fact, I'd argue that your skills are more important than both your gear and your mutations / cybernetics. While not as obviously powerful as exploding some dude's head with your mind, skills shape your run in the more subtle, less appreciated ways that are nonetheless extremely important. Here, I'll be covering all the skills in the game and analyzing when I would want to have that skill: Early Game (levels 1-20), Mid Game (levels 20-30), or Late Game (levels 30+). For weapon skills, I will be assuming that this weapon plays into your primary weapon build. I will also cover factions that teach the skill and if it's worth it to learn it that way or learn it with skill points if applicable. Finally, if I think the skill is not worth the skill points I will make mention of that.

## Acrobatics

### Swift Reflexes

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 75sp; 17 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Cats (Not Worth)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Swift Reflexes.png" /></span><span class="skill">Swift Reflexes</span></span> is one of those must-have skills and is the intro skill to the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Acrobatics.png" /></span><span class="skill">Acrobatics</span></span> tree. The description of the skill is actually a bit misleading; you see it doesn't actually give you 5 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>. Instead, _not_ having it reduces your <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> by 5 against missile weapons. While it won't save you if you just dump <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>, this skill makes it so you can perfectly avoid all projectiles from non-legendary creatures at 25 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> or more, which is a reliable <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> to have by end game. Of course, it's useful before that since we're bound to be shot quite a bit on our journey to the end game, so avoiding those projectiles means you'll get there more often.

### Spry

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 17 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Free +2 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>, this is an incredible skill. Take this always, literally always.

### Jump

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 17 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Frogs, Svardym (Frogs Not Worth, Svardym Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Legendary Frogs are actually not so easy to find while legendary Svardym lairs are decently common and you'll probably want Svardym rep anyways so if you don't have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> by then, it's worth the pickup. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> moves you two squares in a single turn, but you can't <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> over any creatures so while it's an inferior engage tool to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> is more defensive in nature or can give you that extra bump to be able to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> in. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> is functionally similar to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span>, just not quite as good and with a longer cooldown. The primary reason to use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> therefore is to extend your gap between an enemy or to cross hazardous pools of liquid and pits.

This skill also synergizes with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Wings.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Wings</span></span> as they greatly increase the distance you can <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> with mutation level, and if you for some reason want to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> further as a true-kin you can install <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/PneumaticPistons.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">p</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="Y">u</span><span class="Y">m</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="Y">t</span><span class="Y">i</span><span class="Y">c</span><span class="Y"> </span><span class="Y">p</span><span class="Y">i</span><span class="Y">s</span><span class="Y">t</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="Y">s</span></span></span></span>.

### Tumble

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 23 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This skill just buffs <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> and gives 1 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>, and we're really taking this for the <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>. Every free point of <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> you get is points you can put to <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> instead and make yourself as durable as possible. You want <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> anyway since it's a good skill, so getting to reduce its cooldown and give that <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> is just more incentive to get <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span>.

## Axes

### Axe Proficiency

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 50sp; 0 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

A permanent +2 to hit is quite good actually, and is one of the more noticeable weaknesses of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span>. This allows you to focus mainly on <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> for your build and still have a reliable chance to hit (as long as you don't dump <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>). Being the base skill for <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axes</span></span>, you're gonna have to get this one if you plan on using them seriously.

### Charging Strike

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 19 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cleave.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cleave</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> is arguably the best melee skill in the game and skills that synergize directly with it like this are part of the reason why. Double the chance to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dismember</span></span> and our <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cleave.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cleaves</span></span> are more deadly if they land. Passive benefit that you'll get a lot of mileage out of.

### Cleave

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 19 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This skill really incentivises you to use as many hands as possible with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axes</span></span> and pump your <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> up as high as you can as you can very quickly shred apart the armor of enemies. Even early game, cleaving off even just 1 or 2 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> can result in more penetrations and deceptively higher damage. While this skill is not enough for you to rip apart the very highest armored enemies in the game, against anything less you'll shred them to pieces quite fast.

### Dismember

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 21 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cleave.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cleave</span></span> a few times then hit <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dismember</span></span> to permanently cripple your enemy. If you chop off their main limb, you may just win the fight outright. Added chance to just do this on normal attacks as well and you can find yourself able to fight and kill enemies beyond what your stats would normally suggest. It's random what limb you chop off so success is likely but not exactly reliable which is the one real drawback of this skill; don't rely on it to save you.

### Hook and Drag

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 23 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No (Sometimes)

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Hook and Drag.png" /></span><span class="skill">Hook and Drag</span></span> is pretty underrated; but it is one skill I'm willing to sacrifice if I need the skill points elsewhere. You essentially have up to 9 rounds of guaranteed hits on an enemy, which can be very powerful on enemies that have high <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>. If you have decent <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>, then this becomes redundant since you just hit all the time anyways so then it's really just used to attack an enemy as you bring them somewhere which isn't usually any functionally different than just moving there and then picking up combat where you left off.

This changes when you have significantly enhanced movement speed, as now <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Hook and Drag.png" /></span><span class="skill">Hook and Drag</span></span> lets you attack as fast as you can move which synergizes very well with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Legs.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Multiple Legs</span></span>, cathedras and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/MotorizedTreads.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">m</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="Y">t</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="Y">r</span><span class="Y">i</span><span class="Y">z</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="Y">d</span><span class="Y"> </span><span class="Y">t</span><span class="Y">r</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="Y">d</span><span class="Y">s</span></span></span></span>. So unless you have one of those or very poor <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>, you can probably give this a miss for your build.

### Decapitate

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 25 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dismember</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

A low chance to just win the fight immediately (on most enemies). It's not reliable mind you, but happens often enough to be very nice. A surprising number of things need a head, so don't sleep on trying to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dismember</span></span> everything you fight; it may be far more effective than you think.

### Berserk!

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 300sp; 29 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dismember</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

By the time you get this, you should have a powerful enough build already where this skill is nice but not exactly required. Because of this and the massive skill point investment, I'll often avoid taking this until I don't have any other helpful skills to take anymore. Make no mistake though, is extremely powerful and can nearly guarantee your victory against a single enemy.

The duration on it is very bad, but 5 rounds is really all you need for most enemies. Even if they survive, unless none of your attacks penetrate they will be so crippled the fight should just be over. Just don't expect this skill to give you the win against every enemy in the game.

## Bow and Rifle

### Draw a Bead / Steady Hands

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 19 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

You get both of these at the same time, so I'll analyze them together. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Steady Hands.png" /></span><span class="skill">Steady Hands</span></span> just makes you more accurate, which if you're using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Bow and Rifle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Bow and Rifles</span></span> then you're gonna want that. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Draw a Bead.png" /></span><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span> makes you even more accurate by spending a turn. If you've got a lot of space between you and your target, this is good and especially useful earlier in the game. Once you get highly accurate guns and high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> you'll stop using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Draw a Bead.png" /></span><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span> for the accuracy and instead use it in conjunction with other <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Bow and Rifle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Bow and Rifle</span></span> skills. As the intro skills, these are super useful to anyone using these weapons.

### Suppressive Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 19 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Draw a Bead.png" /></span><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

By spamming this you can lock an enemy down indefinitely. The shot does have to penetrate which means enemies with high <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> will be able to shrug it off, but for all others this just gives you a practically free win against a melee enemy. It's very good, if only all the other <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Bow and Rifle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Bow and Rifle</span></span> skills were similar this would actually be a cool tree worthy of investment.

### Sure Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 19 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Draw a Bead.png" /></span><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

You lose your mark to fire 1 (one!) shot that is guaranteed to hit. Most rifles have fairly high accuracy anyways so any rifle worth using better than a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Carbine.png" /></span><span class="object">carbine</span></span> is getting virtually no benefit from this anyways since it wasn't going to miss with the boost from both <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Draw a Bead.png" /></span><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Steady Hands.png" /></span><span class="skill">Steady Hands</span></span>. It's not like 150 skill points is a trivial cost either, this is quite expensive. Get something better.

### Wounding Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 19 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Draw a Bead.png" /></span><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

You cause a bleed for each penetration you do and lose your mark. You're probably only penetrating 3-5 times max, so that's a 3-5 damage bleed that the enemy can save from for the cost of your mark. This is pathetic, the cost is too high for too small a benefit.

### Disorienting Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 200sp; 25 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Draw a Bead.png" /></span><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Wounding Fire.png" /></span><span class="skill">Wounding Fire</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Even if the effect from this skill was worth the cost (200 skill points with 250 skill points of skill prerequisites), you only get this benefit if the target cannot see or hear any allies; so virtually never unless this is the last enemy. What do we get for this? -4 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="stat">MA</span></span>. Most enemies aren't that hard to hit so the <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> is pretty useless and unless you're using lots of mental attacks against the last enemy, the <span class="injected"><span class="stat">MA</span></span> is also pretty useless. Not worth the investment.

### Beacon Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 200sp; 25 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Draw a Bead.png" /></span><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Sure Fire.png" /></span><span class="skill">Sure Fire</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

You need to ignite your enemy for this to work, which can be done if you're willing to liberally use thermal grenades but all you get from this is your shot critting. If you spend the turns you would need to mark the target and throw the grenade, you'd be doing more damage than if you use this skill. If your target is so ignited that it's locked in place, who cares about a crit it's probably dead soon anyways.

### Flattening Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 200sp; 25 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Draw a Bead.png" /></span><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Suppressive Fire.png" /></span><span class="skill">Suppressive Fire</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

The effect of this is insanely good, in fact it's one of the best skill effects in the game. It not only locks them in place, but also knocks them prone and disarms them. So why is it not worth it? Well, in order to gain this benefit the enemy must have 6 walls surrounding them. In case you can't visualize what that means, it means they must be in a 1 tile wide corridor in order for this to work. If you have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Wall.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Force Wall</span></span> then you can reliably do this. Otherwise, if you want to meticulously construct corridors for yourself and lure enemies in there to use this skill, go ahead. Simply put, most of the time you won't even be able to use this.

### Ultra Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 300sp; 29 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Draw a Bead.png" /></span><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Worth:** No

</div>

If there was more than 1 fire ability that was worth it, this would be an insane skill. Unfortunately, they're all trash so you should give this a miss as well.

## Cooking and Gathering

### Meal Preparation

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 15 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Villagers of Kyakukya (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Being able to gain cooking effects is run changing and very important for any successful run. Cooking is not my preferred way to play as managing ingredients and rerolling when I get an effect I don't want is annoying and tedious for me, so instead I usually just use ingredients that have 1 or 2 effects in order for me to more reliably get the one I want. So unless I'm using an ingredient like spine fruit jam or phase silk I usually just go for jerky for <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span><span class="stat">HP</span></span> effects.

This is an admittedly simplistic approach to cooking and you can get some very strong effects, but often times to _really_ get what you want out of cooking you'll need <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Carbide Chef.png" /></span><span class="skill">Carbide Chef</span></span> since there's just a ton of variance up until then. Even if you just follow my approach of spamming <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span><span class="stat">HP</span></span> increase cooking effects, this is still a very good skill you should have in every run.

A word of caution though is that you should definitely just get it for reputation from Mayor <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Mayor Nuntu.png" /></span><span class="object">Nuntu</span></span> at Kyakukya. It's not so good that you need it ASAP, and it's pretty safe to just travel to Kyakukya around the time you're going to Grit Gate to save yourself the 100sp.

### Harvestry

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 50sp; 15 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Villagers of Joppa (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

If you're planning on doing a lot of cooking, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Harvestry.png" /></span><span class="skill">Harvestry</span></span> is going to be one of your primary ways of getting good ingredients. Even if you're not planning on doing much cooking, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Harvestry.png" /></span><span class="skill">Harvestry</span></span> is still useful in getting monetarily valuable ingredients and the coveted yondercane for an escape tool. In the very early game it's also quite good for getting you some extra Witchwood Bark in case you get put in one too many dangerous scenarios.

Again, it's so reliable to get Joppa reputation if you take the Joppa start, so just ask <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Mehmet.png" /></span><span class="object">Mehmet</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/ElderBob.png" /></span><span class="object">Irudad</span></span> to teach you rather than spend the 50sp.

### Butchery

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 50sp; 15 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Cannibals (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Butchery.png" /></span><span class="skill">Butchery</span></span> is the second main way of getting your ingredients. Not only can you get valuable ingredients from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandButcherToggle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Butchering</span></span> corpses, the ingredients you get here are typically much more expensive than ones you get from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Harvestry.png" /></span><span class="skill">Harvestry</span></span> at the cost of being heavier. Further still, you can butcher certain types of corpses for valuable items (<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Ogre Ape.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="W">o</span><span class="W">g</span><span class="W">r</span><span class="W">e</span><span class="W"> </span><span class="W">a</span><span class="W">p</span><span class="W">e</span><span class="W">s</span></span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Kaleidoslug.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="K">k</span><span class="C">a</span><span class="y">l</span><span class="m">e</span><span class="M">i</span><span class="r">d</span><span class="c">o</span><span class="C">s</span><span class="Y">l</span><span class="y">u</span><span class="K">g</span><span class="K">s</span></span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Quartz Baboon.png" /></span><span class="object">quartz baboons</span></span>, etc). Don't bother wasting time grinding Cannibal rep for this, just spend the 50 skill points. Be careful with this if you don't have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Meal Preparation.png" /></span><span class="skill">Meal Preparation</span></span>, since many <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandButcherToggle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Butchered</span></span> ingredients can be quite heavy when unprocessed.

If you take the Hills village start, your village will teach <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Butchery.png" /></span><span class="skill">Butchery</span></span> in which case definitely get it for rep.

### Spicer

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 50sp; 17 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Denizens of Yd Freehold (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Like <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Meal Preparation.png" /></span><span class="skill">Meal Preparation</span></span>, you really want <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Carbide Chef.png" /></span><span class="skill">Carbide Chef</span></span> to actually make use of this because until then you're tossing lots of ingredients into the wind in the hopes that you get what you want. But you can get this for rep from Yd Freehold and there's nothing else to do for that faction rep so might as well. Damage reflection effects in particular are good ones that you'll probably be interested in the enhanced version for.

### Carbide Chef

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 17 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Using this, you're actually able to control what cooking effects you get. If you can get a good amount of ingredients, and especially if you combine this with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Spicer.png" /></span><span class="skill">Spicer</span></span>, you can get some very powerful cooking effects with perfect reliability. If you're planning on sophisticated cooking, this is a very useful skill to have.

The most powerful kinds of recipes are pretty much exclusively on-trigger effects. Ideally, you're looking for something that you can trigger often and then do something that's handy. Some standout examples are to trigger certain attacks (<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shank.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shank</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dismember</span></span>) when you do things you can do often (reflect damage, crit, etc).

## Cudgel

### Cudgel Proficiency

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 50sp; 0 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

+2 to hit is pretty big, just like it is for <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axes</span></span>. Being the intro skill for <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span>, if you're interested in seriously using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span> at all then this is a must-have.

### Bludgeon

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 17 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This skill is the single thing that makes <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span> good. Daze and stun are both some of the best and most reliable debuffs to put on an enemy, and having a 50% chance at that is pretty huge. Combine this with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Double-muscled.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Double-muscled</span></span> and not only do you have the synergy from the extra <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>, but you also get an even better chance to daze and stun. It's not uncommon for many <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgel</span></span> builds to be capable of permanently or nearly permanently stunning all enemies, which is good because <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgel</span></span> damage is pretty awful.

### Charging Strike

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 19 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Bludgeon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Bludgeon</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Start off the fight with a free daze? Potentially even a stun? Incredible, very good skill. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> remains a critical part of every melee build, super worth it. Something to note is that this is actually the same skill as the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axe</span></span> version; if you have this skill then you have that skill as well and vice-versa.

### Conk

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 21 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Bludgeon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Bludgeon</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Apes (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

It's an activated skill, but the cooldown is incredibly short and gives you a free daze or stun. If they're already stunned, you can actually just put them out of commission for the whole fight in case you're being attacked by multiple enemies. As long as you don't attack them, they'll stay down for an incredibly long time giving you plenty of room to clear out any other attackers.

### Backswing

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 23 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Not only does this just flat out increase your DPS by 25%, but it also gives you more chances to daze and stun since you're attacking more times with a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgel</span></span>. Great skill to have, seriously improves your fighting abilities. If you are using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span>, the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Expertise.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weapon Expertise</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Mastery.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weapon Mastery</span></span> skills _do affect_ your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Backswing.png" /></span><span class="skill">Backswing</span></span> strikes as well.

### Slam

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 25 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This is the first <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgel</span></span> skill that I will often skip out on. It's not that it's a bad skill, it's just not quite as good as the rest. The problem with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Slam.png" /></span><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> is that it pushes away your opponent which is usually not what you want to do. If you don't engage with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>, then you can follow up a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Slam.png" /></span><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> with a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> and is quite effective, but you should probably have just engaged with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>. If there's just one enemy, this combo is quite good but when there are multiple enemies, you can't follow up on the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Slam.png" /></span><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> quite as effectively.

### Demolish

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 300sp; 29 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Slam.png" /></span><span class="skill">Slam</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

I'm mixed on <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Demolish.png" /></span><span class="skill">Demolish</span></span>, but by the time you can get it you're probably not needing the 100% daze chance because you're either already near permanently stunning everything or you have Precision Nanon Fingers and already have a 150% chance to daze anyways. The fact that you need <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Slam.png" /></span><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> to get it as well means you need to spend the skill points on <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Slam.png" /></span><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> which is only arguably worth it to begin with, and having no cooldown on <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Slam.png" /></span><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> is pretty tough to make full use out of since <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Demolish.png" /></span><span class="skill">Demolish</span></span> only lasts 5 turns and the whole point of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Slam.png" /></span><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> is that you push away the enemy.

If you have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Wall.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Force Wall</span></span>, then wrapping your enemy in a forcefield is quite a good combination now. Instead of pushing your opponent away, they're locked in (unless your <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> is obscenely high, in which case they're probably 1 shot anyway) and can highly benefit from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Backswing.png" /></span><span class="skill">Backswing</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Mastery.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weapon Mastery</span></span>/<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Expertise.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weapon Expertise</span></span> for the whole 5 turns. Can it be good? Yea, it can. Is it really a vital part of a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgel</span></span> build? Not at all.

## Customs and Folklore

### Tactful

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 19 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Villagers of Ezra (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

While you shouldn't really ever purchase this with skill points, it's always worth the pickup from Ezra since you reliably get 200 rep by water ritualing <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Terrain/Haddas.png" /></span><span class="object">Haddas</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Warden 1-FF.png" /></span><span class="object">1-FF</span></span>. With no other reason to get Ezra rep, this is just a helpful boost that can potentially get you that extra bump to get past reputation thresholds. Again, don't get it with skill points, but always get it for rep.

### Trash Divining

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 21 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Pariahs (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

Another one you'll probably only want to get through reputation rather than buy with skill points. As long as you're crawling around the world and at least investigating points of interest when prompted, you usually have no shortage of secrets to share. You can learn some pretty obscure secrets and sometimes some pretty useful stuff, but it's all RNG so you may just get nothing but 300 goatfolk villages. It's pretty easy to get Pariah rep, especially because the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Lulihart.png" /></span><span class="object">Lulihart</span></span> at the Stilt can be water ritualed.

## Multiweapon Fighting

### Flurry / Multiweapon Proficiency

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 17 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> or 17 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Hindren of Bey Lah - <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Eskhind.png" /></span><span class="object">Eskhind</span></span> (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

In order to be taught these skills, you need to ensure <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Eskhind.png" /></span><span class="object">Eskhind</span></span> becomes the Hindriarch which is not even a guarantee in every playthrough. If the stars align for you and you for some reason don't have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Flurry.png" /></span><span class="skill">Flurry</span></span> / <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Proficiency.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Proficiency</span></span> yet, then it's worth the rep.

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Flurry.png" /></span><span class="skill">Flurry</span></span> makes a strike with every limb, which is actually quite good to guarantee the hits. It doesn't pair with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jab</span></span>, however, so it's not quite as good as it could be. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Proficiency.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Proficiency</span></span> brings our offhand strike chance from 15% to 35%; a considerable increase but still not that great. While <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span>, you should almost always have an offhand <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jab</span></span>; anything else and you're missing out on DPS. One handy thing about <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Flurry.png" /></span><span class="skill">Flurry</span></span> is that it does have an <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> prerequisite, meaning its cooldown can be nullified with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Triple-jointed.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Triple-jointed</span></span>.

Something not immediately obvious is that <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Flurry.png" /></span><span class="skill">Flurry</span></span> actually pairs very well with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span>. When <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Flurry.png" /></span><span class="skill">Flurry</span></span> says it makes an attack with every limb, it really means _every limb_, and the fact that these strikes are _not_ offhand strikes means that each attack will apply the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span> benefits (<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Penetrating Strikes.png" /></span><span class="skill">Penetrating Strikes</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Mastery.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weapon Mastery</span></span> alike).

Something to note is that all <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> skills affect natural arms, mutated arms (including those from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Arms.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Multiple Arms</span></span>), _and_ robotic arms (from helping hands). They **do not** affect special limbs that have natural weaponry like the head with the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Horns</span></span> mutation or <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stinger</span></span>.

Before the introduction of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span>, this tree was the clear best choice in terms of damage. Now, without the proper build to utilize this tree correctly, you're better off with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span>. However, if you do decide to build around this tree from character creation, you can create a whirlwind of blades for devastating effect. You'll just have to have this in mind from the start to do it properly.

### Multiweapon Expertise

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 150sp; 23 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> or 23 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Proficiency.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Proficiency</span></span>

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Expertise.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Expertise</span></span> brings us up to a 50% offhand strike chance. Combine this with elemental mods on each weapon and we already have a very powerful build. If you still are using a non-<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> in your offhand, stop immediately. Swap to a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span>, it's just miles better.

### Multiweapon Mastery

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 200sp; 27 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> or 27 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Expertise.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Expertise</span></span>

If you're lucky enough to find this being taught by a random village, it actually only offers a 15% increase; it's just all the other increases from required skills continue to give their benefits as well to the cumulative total. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Mastery.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Mastery</span></span> brings our offhand strike chance to 65%. We've made it all the way to the end here, but to get the most out of this tree we want to staple as many limbs and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> as possible to our body. Pop in those girshling dentures, strap a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/ArmDagger4.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="B">f</span><span class="B">o</span><span class="B">l</span><span class="B">d</span><span class="B">e</span><span class="B">d</span><span class="B"> </span><span class="B">c</span><span class="B">a</span><span class="B">r</span><span class="B">b</span><span class="B">i</span><span class="B">d</span><span class="B">e</span></span> wristblade</span></span> to all 4 of your arms (you picked <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Arms.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Multiple Arms</span></span>, didn't you?) and just go to town. Bonus points if you have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Double-muscled.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Double-muscled</span></span> for the stun chance.

## Endurance

### Shake It Off

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 0 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness">Toughness</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shake It Off.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shake It Off</span></span> is not a skill you'll notice particularly often in terms of the "shake off" effect. Only very powerful characters ever get to 30 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness">Toughness</span></span>, so your chances of shaking off the effect are almost always going to be under 20%. That's still nothing to sneeze at and can definitely save you, but for most of the game you're going to be looking at a much more modest 10-15% chance. The other effect of this skill is the more important one early and that is the 25% less poison damage and duration effect. This is often a very early skill I take since the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Sting</span></span> of a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Scorpiock.png" /></span><span class="object">scorpiock</span></span> cannot miss and can easily destroy a lower level character.

Very, very few enemies have this skill, so not having it simply puts you on par with other enemies that happen to find themselves in deep liquid. You should just avoid deep liquid in general and most of the map doesn't even have deep liquid to begin with; even less places have unavoidable deep liquid. I've always found other, more appealing options to take than this one, but if you have the Fish reputation this skill is just a straight upgrade whenever you find yourself in deep liquid so you might as well, especially because Fish reputation is great to have.

If you're particularly worried about <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/GolgothaSlog.png" /></span><span class="object">Slog</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Scorpiock.png" /></span><span class="object">scorpiocks</span></span>, then taking this skill is fine to do early. The issue with this skill is that it's 100 skill points for a damage type that is just extremely rare and becomes even rarer post Golgotha. Something to note is that despite looking very similar, poison gas and corrosive gas are different with corrosive gas being more prevalent, more dangerous, and most importantly of all not poison. Take this skill if you're still uncomfortable around Golgotha otherwise you can skip.

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weathered.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weathered</span></span> is a must-have skill as sources of fire and cold damage are everywhere and just taking 15% less damage from that is an easy win. With rank 16 <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Carapace</span></span>, you can actually be fully immune to cold and fire damage and swim around in lava for fun. This skill is single-handedly enough for you to have a comfortable amount of cold resistance for Bethesda Susa and can be made even better with many sources of cold or fire resistance early like ape fur gear for cold resistance or Issachari gear for fire resistance.

I'm admittedly biased here, but I'm not a huge user of tonics (other than <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SalveTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">s</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="Y">l</span><span class="Y">v</span><span class="Y">e</span></span> injectors</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/LoveTonic.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">l</span><span class="R">o</span><span class="Y">v</span><span class="Y">e</span></span> injectors</span></span>) in general. Being able to ingest 2 has rarely ever been something I have wanted to do but if you play a style where everything revolves around constantly injecting tonics that you craft or something like that then I can see this being a little more useful. Some powerful combinations are skulk + hulk honey, hulk honey + salve, blaze + hulk honey, blaze + salve and salve + skulk. Get other skills first and maybe take another look at this one if you're a menace for those tonics.

This skill and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weathered.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weathered</span></span> are the whole reason to go into the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Endurance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Endurance</span></span> tree.

There has never been a moment where I thought to myself "If only <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> didn't run out so soon". <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> being on cooldown has certainly been an issue, but never it not lasting long enough. For 250 skill points we can get better skills that result in us not needing to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> at all, and certainly as the game goes on you will find yourself using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> less and less. By the time you even have the stats to get this, you probably won't need it (even more so because if you have 25 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness">Toughness</span></span>, you're already beefy).

If you are using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span>, this skill is an obvious take if you value your sanity. Actually, even if you are not using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span> or not using them often this is still a pretty decent take. This doesn't just reduce their weight for equipped <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span>, but also for <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span> just sitting in your inventory. Not only will it reduce the weight of the weapon, but it will also reduce the weight of everything in the weapon as well (even the oil in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Flamethrower.png" /></span><span class="object">flamethrowers</span></span>). It's 100 skill points to make <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span> more worth their weight in value so if you tend to pick up <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span> often or are tired of that backup <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Flamethrower.png" /></span><span class="object">flamethrower</span></span> weighing you down, give this a pickup.

Again assuming you are actually using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span>, this is a great skill to have. Lower movement speed is perhaps the most crippling thing about <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span> and getting rid of that is fantastic. Not worth it if you are the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapon</span></span> dabbler, but if you have one constantly equipped make sure to get this skill.

In fact, on the explosive ones it's incredibly dangerous to use since you've got a decent chance to just blow yourself up. It requires you to expend ammo for each shot you make, so while you're definitely putting ordinance downrange you're probably better off just shooting normally and controlling where those shots end up; especially since most <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Heavy Weapon.png" /></span><span class="skill">Heavy Weapon</span></span> shots come at a premium.

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> are a class of weapon that has a considerable amount of complexity surrounding it. The secret to understanding these weapons is to understand the stances, which we start with two: <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandAggressiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandDefensiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Defensive Stance</span></span>. Switching between stances is free, we can do it as many times as we want meaning we may always attack with the stance we want. The tradeoff is that we also have to defend with the same stance as we attack with. Something key to understand is that <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> do not get the free +2 to hit like other weapons, so they particularly benefit from having good <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>. Let's break down each stance.

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandDefensiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Defensive Stance</span></span> should be the stance you primarily stay in; your de facto stance. This stance is what makes <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> easily the best weapon for non-melee combatants as you can have any <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blade</span></span> equipped and benefit while other classes of weapons only benefit you while you're actively attacking with them. This is also a powerful stance to increase your durability as having bonus <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> means you can invest more into <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> in the rare event that you do get hit if your build revolves primarily around <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>.

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandAggressiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span> is a unique tradeoff, as against enemies with poor <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> you can deal more damage than other weapons with your attacks. Against enemies with good or decent <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> suffer quite a bit in comparison to other weapons and this issue is exacerbated even more against enemies like goatfolk with decent <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>. Of course, in order for any of this to be useful, you have to have the game knowledge and understand what stats enemies have or use things like scanning to be able to read that information in-game. Stances apply to offhand <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> as well, and since <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> get a +1 to hit from skills, this stance can make <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> builds even more lethal as <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> have less penalty and with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> skills can reap even more from the benefit.

Most of the time, you'll end up using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandDefensiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Defensive Stance</span></span> as <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandAggressiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span> is quite situational and requires much more game knowledge to utilize in those proper situations.

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> is a costly skill and oftentimes I end up not taking it in order to hit other skills instead, but it's got a low cooldown and some pretty decent effects that synergize with multiple play styles depending on the stance. Something to note is that with every <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> you will also attack and apply venom with a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stinger</span></span> if you have one and hit with it.

While in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandAggressiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> will move through a single tile between you and the enemy and make a strike at the enemy. This strike is at +2 <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> on top of your existing +1 <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandAggressiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span>. This makes this a very powerful opener if you land it. You can combine this with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> to get a second <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> in the middle of combat or to open yourself up to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> if you happen to find yourself suddenly in melee. Since this takes you through only 1 square, it tends to be less useful than <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> but is a handy alternative especially since you have extra <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span>.

While in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandDefensiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Defensive Stance</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> will make an attack and then move you back 2 tiles. The enemy will of course likely just walk towards you on their next turn but this is a great skill in combination with ranged builds which makes <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> and sitting in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandDefensiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Defensive Stance</span></span> even more appealing as you can back up for some free shots. This skill works particularly well with confusing or paralyzing venom from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stinger</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>; you can <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span>, apply your venom, and then <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> back in for a rapid series of attacks since the venom will prevent the enemy from moving closer. It also works in a similar way with high amounts of quickness as the enemy will be too slow to close the gap before you <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> back in.

While in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dueling Stance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dueling Stance</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> is guaranteed to hit and penetrate at least once, and in addition to all that will have a +1 <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span>. This makes this particular version of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> the one you'll want to use if <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> comes off cooldown in the middle of combat or if you need to secure a kill or bypass heavy amounts of <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>. In addition to that, since <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> has an <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> prerequisite our cooldown can be potentially nullified by <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Triple-jointed.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Triple-jointed</span></span> in which case we can use this repeatedly. We can also use this to get extra chances on applying our venom with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stinger</span></span> since if the enemy resists the poison from our <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span>, we can then use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Sting</span></span> to try again.

In <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandAggressiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span>, you make an attack against everything in melee with you except allies, which means you attack all enemies and walls / furniture around you. Now, if you're hitting more than 1 enemy with this you have more important problems to worry about than trying to hit them with a single attack. If you're not hitting more than 1 enemy with this, if you're <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> then it can be inferior to bump attacking because your offhand strikes will not proc. However, if you're <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span> then by all means.

In <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandDefensiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Defensive Stance</span></span>, you push all creatures in melee with you back 1 space and try to trip the enemies. This synergizes extremely well with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandAggressiveStance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span> and can be used to give yourself some space for ranged attacks or for positioning adjustments. Another great defensive tool for ranged builds.

In <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dueling Stance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dueling Stance</span></span>, you have the crown jewel of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blade</span></span> effects: a highly effective disarm. This rarely fails even against powerful enemies and for many creatures that use weapons, being disarmed can completely neuter them. Enemies will not try to pick up their disarmed weapon, and will instead just scratch at you with their <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Albino ape fist.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">f</span><span class="Y">i</span><span class="Y">s</span><span class="Y">t</span><span class="Y">s</span></span></span></span> or other natural weapons they may have.

We get +1 <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> at the cost of -1 to hit, which by mid game or late game is very worth it with specifically vibro weapons; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Improved Aggressive Stance.png" /></span><span class="skill">Improved Aggressive Stance</span></span> goes nuts with vibro weapons which we're fairly likely to have by the time we pick this skill up.

The attribute prerequisites are pretty high, so you won't even be capable of getting this until late. 10 rounds is quite a long time to be able to spam <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Swipe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Swipe</span></span>, but there's a small issue. You don't really want to spam <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Swipe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Swipe</span></span> unless you are for some reason fighting multiple enemies with weapons and need to disarm them all right now. That means that you're left with just being able to really spam <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span>. Don't get me wrong, 10 turns of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> can be pretty good but 300 skill points for that is a pretty steep investment. If you didn't get <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> or don't plan on using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> for most of the game, then give this skill a pass. If you are an avid <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> user, then this is a great skill for you, especially if you have a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stinger</span></span> and / or are heavily invested in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span>.

## Persuasion

### Menacing Stare

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 17 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Flowers (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Sometimes

</div>

Let's be clear here, is there never a reason to take this skill? No, this can be a perfectly usable skill and even be pretty clutch in some tight moments. The problem here is that it has a 17 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> prerequisite and has a chance to fail which means that unless you are building <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> specifically, you will be hard pressed to get much if any use out of this skill. While this is great news for <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Espers</span></span>, for everyone else you'll be better off with other skills. For <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Espers</span></span> and anyone with the <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> to actually make use of this skill, you can use it to create distance between you and scary enemies as well as interrupt <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Sunder Mind</span></span> from a distance. If you have a ton of Flower reputation this can be a somewhat good pickup if you have the stats, but that's not likely and you really want 250 Flower rep to make <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Tongue Tyrant.png" /></span><span class="object">tongue tyrants</span></span> neutral to you by endgame.

### Intimidate

**Worth:** No

</div>

In the rare scenario you find yourself surrounded, this can be effective. But the melee range and the long cooldown make this a steep cost for 200 skill points, especially because only <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> builds can make use of it. Even then, if you're an <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> build you probably don't want to be anywhere near enemies and should have many other, better ways of getting away or keeping yourself away from enemies.

### Berate

<div class="section-info">

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** Hermits (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

The great thing about this skill is it always works and has a pretty long duration, 6-36 rounds. It also has a decent range of 8 tiles (unlimited with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Telepathy.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Telepathy</span></span>) and is a guaranteed way of breaking <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Sunder Mind</span></span>. It also won't make the target try to kill you, so it naturally synergizes with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Proselytize.png" /></span><span class="skill">Proselytize</span></span> to get neutral creatures as followers (<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Domination</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Beguiling.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Beguiling</span></span> will still anger the creature, so use at your own risk). The bad thing about this skill is that you have to get <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Menacing Stare.png" /></span><span class="skill">Menacing Stare</span></span> first, so it's usually not worth it in total to take this skill because the cost is a bit higher than displayed. However, if you already have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Menacing Stare.png" /></span><span class="skill">Menacing Stare</span></span> then this is actually a pretty good pickup. If you manage to find legendary Hermits, this is also a good pickup to get from them.

This skill is incredible because it will essentially nullify the downside of a low <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> build of awful trade prices. The best part of this skill is that it is obtainable by reputation with the Consortium of Phyta, of which you can always find 2 legendary members for you to learn this skill from: <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Asphodel.png" /></span><span class="object">Asphodel</span></span> and the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/OasisGlowpad.png" /></span><span class="object">oddly-hued glowpad</span></span>. You can ritual both of them, ritual one and trade 2 secrets, or ritual one with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tactful.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tactful</span></span> and trade 1 secret. Get this skill always, but don't pay skill points for it since getting it through reputation is so reliable and so easy.

### Proselytize

**Requirements:** 300sp; 23 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Mechanimists (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

This skill has a very hefty skill point cost, and since Mechanimist reputation is so easy to get, you shouldn't really get this skill through skill points. If you like followers, then this is a must-have skill. Indeed, followers can be quite powerful and in particular this is the only way to get a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/SoupSludgeSpawnerTier5.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="c">s</span><span class="c">o</span><span class="c">u</span><span class="c">p</span><span class="c">y</span></span> sludge</span></span> as your follower which can be unbelievably deadly if fed liquids. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Proselytize.png" /></span><span class="skill">Proselytize</span></span> won't get you just any follower though, you essentially have to both get past their mental armor and be a higher level than them or else you won't succeed, so those with low <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> will struggle in succeeding with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Proselytize.png" /></span><span class="skill">Proselytize</span></span> for anything but the very weakest in mental armor. On the bright side, you can try this as many times as you want and you will never upset an ally, unlike <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Beguiling.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Beguiling</span></span>.

Even if you stack <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> and have an insane mod, it'll probably only be around 12 which works out to 48 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span><span class="stat">HP</span></span> for insane end-tier god <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span>. Anything less and this just gives even worse <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span><span class="stat">HP</span></span>.

Bleeding typically is not a big problem, but there are a couple late-game sources of bleed that are pretty nasty and last for a fairly considerable amount of time. By then, you probably have a mountain of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Bandage.png" /></span><span class="object">bandages</span></span> that you can run through but for 50 skill points this is not too bad. If you've got the skill points hanging around and are looking to start fighting creatures in Lake Hinnom and beyond, you'll get a bit of use out of this one.

### Nostrums

<div class="section-info">

</div>

There are a few issues with this skill, so let's first cover what it does so we can pick it apart properly. You can instantly cure bleeding, poison, illness and the onset of diseases for anyone in your party, given that you have the resources to do so. Let's start with poison and illness.

There are extremely few sources of poison in the game. There is poison gas, which only a single creature can generate (<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Girshworm.png" /></span><span class="object">girshworms</span></span>) or comes from poison gas grenades, there is the poison <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Stinger Poison.png" /></span><span class="object">stinger</span></span> which only comes from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Scorpiock.png" /></span><span class="object">scorpiocks</span></span> (a rare, very early game enemy) and there is the poison from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/GolgothaSlog.png" /></span><span class="object">Slog</span></span>, the unique boss at the bottom of Golgotha. Illness is the condition that comes at the end of being poisoned. Let's be real, you're not using this skill for either of those, especially since all illness does is temporarily remove your ability to regen health.

Bleeding can be cured here, but unfortunately you must already have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Staunch Wounds.png" /></span><span class="skill">Staunch Wounds</span></span> to get this skill. If you have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Staunch Wounds.png" /></span><span class="skill">Staunch Wounds</span></span>, you don't need to treat bleeding at a campfire. You can just use one of your hundreds of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Bandage.png" /></span><span class="object">bandages</span></span> to do so. If you're at a campfire, it means you're out of danger and also means you can probably just let the bleed heal naturally as well.

The last thing that can be cured is the onset of disease; and note that this is not the full disease itself, this is just the onset of the disease (think sore throat for <span class="injected"><span class="K">g</span><span class="K">l</span><span class="r">o</span><span class="R">t</span><span class="r">r</span><span class="K">o</span><span class="K">t</span></span>). You will still need the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Corpus.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="W">C</span><span class="W">o</span><span class="W">r</span><span class="W">p</span><span class="W">u</span><span class="W">s</span><span class="W"> </span><span class="W">C</span><span class="W">h</span><span class="W">o</span><span class="W">l</span><span class="W">i</span><span class="W">y</span><span class="W">s</span></span></span></span> (or a cheesy meal that cures negative conditions on a trigger) in order to cure the full-blown disease. The problem with this is that really the only time you're likely to have a chance of getting a disease is during Golgotha, at which point you are _extremely unlikely_ to have the **21 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>** necessary for this skill. Even if you did, you could just as easily cure the onset disease by eating the meal in the electric ovens of Grit Gate and munching on some raw yuckwheat. This gives you a massive bonus to saves that is plenty to rid yourself of the onset of the disease.

By the time you have the <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span> necessary for this skill, you're likely already past Golgotha and have access to regeneration tanks if you're _really_ concerned about whatever disease is onset. This is one of those skills that _looks_ appetizing, but in reality has quite a few flaws that hinder its practical usage.

Does what it says on the tin, chop off a part for you or your friends. There are exactly three reasons to use this skill, none of them great:

1. You have a companion infected with a fungal infection and you do not have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Domination</span></span> or the Clever Girl mod; and this fungal infection annoys you enough to want to cure it.
2. Chop off your face and wear it for an <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> bonus (and the achievement I guess).
3. Chop off a limb to use as an atzmus for the Golem.

To make this worse, your companions won't let you go randomly chopping off their limbs so it's not even that effective at #3 either. If you really want to wear your face and have the **23 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>** required for this, go ahead I guess.

It's 100 skill points for about 20 extra <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span><span class="stat">HP</span></span> per salve. This is technically enough to save you, but by the time you have the staggering **25 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>** for this skill, you're probably swimming in salves (if you ever get there). Just pop another one.

I'll be honest, the only legendary Mysterious Stranger I've ever found is a legendary <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Star Kraken.png" /></span><span class="object">star kraken</span></span> so I put not worth it for the rep just because by the time you find that you should long have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Akimbo.png" /></span><span class="skill">Akimbo</span></span>. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Akimbo.png" /></span><span class="skill">Akimbo</span></span> doesn't just shoot both of your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> whenever you shoot, it shoots all of your guns whenever you shoot. That's right, if you happen to have more than just 1 gun of any kind, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Akimbo.png" /></span><span class="skill">Akimbo</span></span> will fire all of them every time you shoot. This means if you have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/GunRack.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">g</span><span class="Y">u</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="Y"> </span><span class="Y">r</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="Y">c</span><span class="Y">k</span></span></span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/GiantHands.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">g</span><span class="Y">i</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="Y">t</span><span class="Y"> </span><span class="Y">h</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="Y">d</span><span class="Y">s</span></span></span></span> or have magnetized guns, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Akimbo.png" /></span><span class="skill">Akimbo</span></span> will shoot all those suckers at once making it a worthwhile pickup even if you're not using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>. It's just a straight up DPS increase, very worth it.

I mean you're probably not using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> much and if you are, you're probably not firing your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>. But, it's 50 skill points so if you've got tastier skills and don't have much to buy then why not; it's cheap enough that in the niche use case you'll use it, it'll come in handy.

The disarm here isn't as reliable as the disarm from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span>, but with high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> and many shots you can disarm pretty often. The only difference here is that you'll kill your target more often before you disarm them with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>, but that's rarely a problem except for the case of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/TinkerTurret.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="c">t</span><span class="c">u</span><span class="c">r</span><span class="c">r</span><span class="c">e</span><span class="c">t</span><span class="c">s</span></span></span></span> where you want their weapons.

If you're heavily relying on your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> in order to deal damage, this is an incredible skill to get. For 20 turns, you essentially double your DPS and this is more pronounced on energy weapons since you never have to reload and gets even better with enhanced quickness. You'll need to stay still to get the full benefit, but enemies will just melt from your damage here. If you aren't heavily invested in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> and only use them as a backup, you may want to skip this one since the skill point cost is quite high.

The cost of this one is steep, and I mean steep. This is the most expensive skill in the game and it has a 29 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> prerequisite. If you can afford it though, this is a fantastic skill to take as it just gives you a permanent increase of DPS by 25%. Again, if <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> are more of a seldom used backup, then it may not be worth taking. If you do use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Pistol.png" /></span><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>, this is your crown jewel.

This one is unusual because it's not that it does something that is particularly useful or game-changing, it just preserves my sanity.

It's passive so your character will just automatically <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Meditate.png" /></span><span class="skill">Meditate</span></span> while resting. If you haven't tried this skill, try it. Resting feels so much better with it. If you somehow have the rep to get this, then pick it up; it doesn't hurt.

There are 3 creatures that are default hostile to you that will cause the terrified effect:

The first 2 are trash, ignore them. You probably won't even have the <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower">Willpower</span></span> needed for this by the time they're of concern. The Knight Commander however makes this more interesting. Typically, these will be legendary creatures in charge of Templar war bands, giving them very high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span>.

The Seekers that use this are very rarely found anyways, so essentially your only real source of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Confusion.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Confusion</span></span> are <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Enigma Snail.png" /></span><span class="object">enigma snails</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span> hunters. Despite this, you will want it if you are planning on taking on the most difficult challenges in Qud (without any spoilers). By the time you'll need it, you should be swimming in skill points so don't bother taking it early.

Again if you've got nothing to spend points on, this can be convenient but 150 skill points is not negligible and you can definitely get better skills for that cost. Something not noted in the description of the skill is that it will also allow you to eat food marked as "gross" like corpses without being famished, which is kinda neat.

Again, like all equipment skills I am rating these assuming you are playing a build that utilizes them. Let's take this time to explain <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> mechanics, since they are not simple or obvious.

Baseline, you have a 25% chance to block an attack if you are wielding a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> in any hand. An equipped <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> will constantly apply the <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> penalty (if it has one), but only apply its <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> benefit on a successful block. If you have multiple <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shields</span></span> equipped, the <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> penalty will apply for each <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span>. When a creature makes an attack on its turn, the chance to block is rolled once. If the block was successful, you gain an <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> bonus for that attack only equal to the highest <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> bonus of all your equipped <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shields</span></span>. That <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> can then no longer block any other attack that creature makes this turn. If the block was unsuccessful, then you gain no <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> benefit for that attack. This process repeats for every subsequent attack made by that creature on this turn.

This means that since many enemies only attack with one limb (or only with an occasional offhand strike), wearing multiple <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shields</span></span> usually isn't worth it since we incur the negatives of the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> at all times. Now that we know <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> mechanics, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Block.png" /></span><span class="skill">Block</span></span> increases our block chance to 50%; not much more to say just makes your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shields</span></span> more effective.

This skill is very powerful, and especially so if you have high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> and a powerful <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span>. The attack can be resisted in which case it doesn't do anything, but if it's not resisted then it will do guaranteed damage that bypasses <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> and will knock the enemy prone which will mean their counterattack is negated for that turn since they'll have to spend it standing up. With decent <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>, this attack will rarely be resisted so you have a very reliable attack in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield Slam.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield Slam</span></span>. Not only do you get the activated attack, but you will also always <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield Slam.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield Slam</span></span> when you <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> which makes your engagements even more deadly. You can also improve your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield Slam.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield Slam</span></span> damage by modding your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> to be <span class="injected"><span class="Y">s</span><span class="R">p</span><span class="R">i</span><span class="R">k</span><span class="R">e</span><span class="Y">d</span></span>.

</div>

There's no rush to pick this skill up, especially at the cost since for most of the game enemies will attack once and rarely twice. However, just because enemies rarely attack more than once doesn't mean they never attack more than once, and they certainly start to much more often as you progress through the game so this is still a very worthwhile pickup since it'll give you the benefit of wielding multiple <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shields</span></span> without actually having to wield multiple <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shields</span></span>.

We now have a 75% chance to block, this is an easy take. A <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> can't benefit you if it doesn't block so we want to boost this at every opportunity.

This skill is by no means reliable in any way. With very high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>, it can become somewhat common but will never be anything but a little sugar on top. A stun for 1-2 rounds is a little low for how uncommon it is to get the stun since you not only have to roll the % chance, but you also have to have blocked the attack in the first place which we can have a maximum 75% chance to do (without relics). Can this skill save you? Absolutely. But there's certainly better, more reliable ways to save yourself or get advantages for the cost so don't go for it until you've filled out the rest of your build.

### Shield Wall

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield Wall.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield Wall</span></span> is like other stance skills, it has zero activation cost. Unlike other stance skills, it has much more attainable costs and the benefits are equally huge. Unfortunately, it does only last 3 turns which isn't much, but can be the difference between life and death if you get yourself caught with enemies on all sides since it literally does block every attack for those 3 turns, regardless of your other <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> skills and regardless of just how many attacks are made against you. You could have 9 <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Oboroqoru.png" /></span><span class="object">Oboroqoru</span></span> using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Flurry.png" /></span><span class="skill">Flurry</span></span> for a total of 54 attacks in one turn, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield Wall.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield Wall</span></span> will block them all. Note that blocking means that you get the benefit of your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shield</span></span>; which for the non-bucklers that you can use this with means you get a significant increase but doesn't make you invincible.

The real thing that puts this stance over others despite its short duration is that it also has a fairly short cooldown as well; meaning that at high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower">Willpower</span></span> you can essentially just spam this for massive <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> benefit. While high <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span> won't make you invincible to everything, it will make you exceptionally difficult to kill for the vast majority of creatures. However, the big caveat is that there are relic / <span class="injected"><span class="M">e</span><span class="M">x</span><span class="m">t</span><span class="m">r</span><span class="y">a</span><span class="y">d</span><span class="Y">i</span><span class="Y">m</span><span class="O">e</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="Y">s</span><span class="y">i</span><span class="m">o</span><span class="m">n</span><span class="M">a</span><span class="M">l</span></span> shields that gain a bonus to block will let you reach a natural 100% block chance. If you have one of those, this leans more towards unnecessary.

The +1 to hit is marginal here, but because it makes our main hand <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> attacks be 25% faster, this actually starts to make <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> look attractive to high quickness builds. Typically though, the real reason to use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> is for offhand attacks with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jab</span></span>. Multiweapon <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> builds are essentially mandatory if you're planning on using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> in your main hand just because <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> have very few effects that require being wielding in your primary hand to be effective, so why not equip a more powerful weapon and get its benefits as well? Aside from this skill, if you're going for offhand <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span>, you'll really just want <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jab</span></span> and maybe <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Bloodletter.png" /></span><span class="skill">Bloodletter</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Rejoinder.png" /></span><span class="skill">Rejoinder</span></span>.

### Jab

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jab</span></span> got a sneaky nerf that seems to have largely flown under the radar, but it went from doubling your offhand <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> strike chance to making it so that when you strike with your offhand <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span>, you strike with it twice. Note here that the key word is _strike_ and not _hit_, so all your offhand strikes with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> are attacking twice with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jab</span></span>. While this may seem like the same thing on first glance, it's not. Instead of ensuring you reliably attack with all your offhand <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> (by raising your hit chance above 100%), you are now vulnerable to probability bringing you into a damage lull when you _really need that damage_. Of course, it just as likely has the chance to give you more damage than possible with the old version of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jab</span></span> and over a long enough period of time, it will _almost_ be just as good.

The other part of the nerf is that bringing your hit chance above 100% will occasionally allow a second attack in addition the guaranteed attack. Since you cannot get an offhand strike chance above 100% without <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Arms.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Multiple Arms</span></span>, you cannot otherwise benefit from this property of offhand strikes anymore and thus the damage is marginally worse in the aggregate.

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jab</span></span> is still extremely good; it definitely still makes <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> the best choice when it comes to offhand strike. If you're not investing in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> then of course it won't be any good for you, but if you are then this skill is a must-have.

This makes your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> attacks do just a bit more damage. It eventually synergizes well with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shank.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shank</span></span>, so it will become important for full <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> builds. Free damage is always nice though, and while <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Bloodletter.png" /></span><span class="skill">Bloodletter</span></span> doesn't give you that significant of an increase, you can stack this quite quickly with multiple <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> and high offhand strike chance.

A hobbled enemy is quite easy to get away from and this will give you a guaranteed penetration on hit. The problem with this skill is you can only use it with a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> in your primary hand, which most builds that use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> will use it as an offhand. If you happen to use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> in your main hand, then this is a good skill. If you don't, then you can give this an easy pass.

### Pointed Circle

<div class="section-info">

I'm giving this a really big caveat: If you specifically are stacking <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Triple-jointed.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Triple-jointed</span></span> and are using main hand <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span>, then you can actually do some pretty nasty damage for free if you get lucky with your procs since <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> has an <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> prerequisite. If you don't, then in order to get any use out of this skill you have to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> into the enemy which you usually specifically don't want to do unless you've found yourself way out of position and an enemy is blocking you. There are many common scenarios where you really, really do not want to swap places with the enemy because it will just be way worse for you. Using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> offensively also means that you cannot use it defensively for the duration of its cooldown, which can be risky. All in all, there are definitely some silly builds where you can stack this a crazy amount but usually this is not worth it.

If you have high <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span>, then this is just a no-brainer take as it'll give you a straight upgrade to your DPS. This can be used regardless of how many times you're attacked at once, so the increase can be quite significant and potentially even allow you to kill weaker support enemies while you focus on a bigger threat. If you have terrible <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> then this won't do anything for you, but otherwise is a great addition.

Something to note is that if you have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Horns</span></span>, you can <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Rejoinder.png" /></span><span class="skill">Rejoinder</span></span> with them. You can do this even if you have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span> on, and it will still benefit from all the things <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span> gives.

While this seems like just free damage from an activated ability, in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> builds this is typically not worth it since you only get a single attack instead of your multiple attacks from your multiple equipped weapons. If you can get multiple bleeds stacked on your target, this can potentially hit for massive damage. While you probably won't be using this to punch through crazy <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>, it can be used to nuke high <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span><span class="stat">HP</span></span> targets especially if you have ways of applying status effects outside of bleed and have a powerful <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span>. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Triple-jointed.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Triple-jointed</span></span> builds can also make use of the <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> prerequisite to potentially spam this attack.

If you have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Mastery.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weapon Mastery</span></span> / <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Expertise.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weapon Expertise</span></span>, this will cause your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shank.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shank</span></span> to hit twice / potentially twice; _both_ with the enhanced <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span>. In these instances, you can pump out some pretty crazy damage if you're able to stack negative effects on your target.

The way this tree is designed is you either take it or you take <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> (or neither, if you hate yourself I guess). If you are a true kin or a mutant without the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Arms.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Multiple Arms</span></span> mutation, you should probably be taking this tree. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> with 4+ limbs is superior in terms of damage with full support, but <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span> is a lot more flexible in playstyle. I'm not doing a lot of talking about this skill in particular because it's pretty mid, but necessary for the rest of the tree. Let's switch gears and discuss the actual skill.

You're very likely to get this skill very early on because you just have to for the actually good skills, and when you get it you'll probably not notice its impact at all. Critical hits are uncommon enough that refreshing weapon or shield cooldowns won't do a whole lot (and you probably don't have many to begin with). However, in the mid-late game this skill goes absolutely insane with long cooldown stance skills like <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/En Garde!.png" /></span><span class="skill">En Garde!</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Berserk!.png" /></span><span class="skill">Berserk!</span></span>, especially because by then you're likely to have <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Expertise.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weapon Expertise</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Mastery.png" /></span><span class="skill">Weapon Mastery</span></span> and you're striking more often meaning more crits or have masterwork gear / <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Precision Nanon Fingers.png" /></span><span class="object">precision <span class="injected"><span class="Y">n</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="Y">n</span></span> fingers</span></span> to boost your crit chances further. It becomes fairly likely for you to crit and then refresh those powerful, long cooldowns and go on an absolute tear, so don't forget you have this as you gain those powerful cooldown skills!

### Weapon Expertise

50% chance to strike again, but the crazy thing about this chance is that it can proc from _any_ attack while you're <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span>. This _includes_ the extra attack from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Backswing.png" /></span><span class="skill">Backswing</span></span>, meaning <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span> can get a large amount of attacks while still benefitting from all of the powerful <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Single Weapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Single Weapon Fighting</span></span> skills. It _also_ includes <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Horns</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stinger</span></span> procs, and if there are guaranteed procs (like from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span>) then those are affected too. There's not much more to say; it's a powerful passive, if you're not <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span><span class="skill">Multiweapon Fighting</span></span> then get this skill.

And here it is, the crown jewel of this skill tree. The way this works is that the game will roll its penetrations normally. It will then add 1 to that number. This means that if you hit, _your attack will always penetrate_. No matter the enemy <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>, you will always penetrate at least once. Combine this with the naturally high <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> of two-handed weapons or the extremely reliable <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Ceremonial Khopesh.png" /></span><span class="object">ceremonial vibrokhopesh</span></span> and you will absolutely rip through enemies. With the vibrokhopesh and this skill, you can turn any build into a melee threat, regardless of their attribute spread.

This also means it pairs extremely well with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axes</span></span>, as in order to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dismember</span></span> you must penetrate the enemies' <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">AV</span></span>. This means as long as you make contact with a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dismember</span></span> strike, it will always <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span><span class="skill">Dismember</span></span>. Combine this with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Berserk!.png" /></span><span class="skill">Berserk!</span></span> and Opportune Strikes and limbs will go flying. Any creature not immune to decapitation is on a serious timer with this brutal combination.

You'll probably not see the value in this very often, but it's common enough to want to <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> to either close the gap on a ranged enemy or to escape from a ranged enemy so having a better chance of dodging those attacks is quite useful. This is especially useful early on in combating <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Slugsnout.png" /></span><span class="object">slugsnouts</span></span> since you'll absolutely want to get away or close the gap on them as fast as possible because of their high damage.

Most of my runs will just ignore this one since I don't throw things very often in general. That's not to say this is a bad skill because for what it does it's actually quite good. It's just that throwing things and more so being accurate with what you throw is rarely that important. If your playstyle revolves heavily on crafting and throwing grenades, then by all means take this skill, you'll see great return. Otherwise, it's just not necessary.

This is my favorite skill in the game, and arguably also the best skill in the game. It has so many applications and so many synergies that it's really hard to overvalue it. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> actually has quite a few mechanics around it, so let's first cover what it does.

When you use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>, you need to select a target 2-3 tiles away from you. Any target within 1 tile is too close. After selecting your target, you'll make an attack on the first wall or creature you hit on the way to that target. You'll then make an attack and if you hit, your attack has +1 <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> on it. If you are in melee with a hostile enemy, you will be unable to use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>.

The first thing to add to the mix is what constitutes a target. A target can be anything that isn't an empty tile, which means you can even target items on the floor. You won't attack items on the floor, so in these cases you will actually <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> beyond your target and get stunned for one turn. You can use this fact as well as the fact that you can <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> walls to use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> as an escape tool as well as an initiation tool. While using <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> in this way has more requirements, it gets you farther than anything else in a single turn.

The second thing to add to the mix is that <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Axes</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span><span class="skill">Shields</span></span> have a dedicated skill that just improves your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> strikes. Those were covered already in their own sections.

The third thing to add is that if you have a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stinger</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Horns</span></span>, you will automatically make strikes with them when you <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>. This means that with these mutations you can make your initiations that much more powerful to potentially kill or disable an enemy on the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> itself.

The fourth thing to add is that you can improve your range significantly whether you're a true kin or a mutant. Mutants can get a level based increase with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Wings.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Wings</span></span> and true kin can use the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Pentaceps.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">p</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="Y">t</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="Y">c</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="Y">p</span><span class="Y">s</span></span></span></span> cybernetic. This means that both your escape and initiation range increase significantly.

The fifth thing to add is that <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> synergizes naturally with many other skills like <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jump</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Swipe.png" /></span><span class="skill">Swipe</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Slam.png" /></span><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> as they all move yourself or the enemy which allow you to get another <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> in the middle of an extended combat. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> has a low cooldown which with middling levels of <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower">Willpower</span></span> can easily allow it to come off cooldown in the middle of many mid-late game fights.

All in all, there's no reason to not get <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> in any run; even runs that you don't fight in melee because of its escape potential.

If you use guns as your primary weapon, this is actually quite good as it'll give you space for more shots. This used to be locked behind the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Bow and Rifle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Bow and Rifle</span></span> tree, so now that it's in the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tactics.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tactics</span></span> tree it's much more valuable since you don't have to buy any <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Bow and Rifle.png" /></span><span class="skill">Bow and Rifle</span></span> skills for non-rifle builds.

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> moves you in any tile you want (except for walls) for literally no opportunity cost. It doesn't just move you fast, it moves you instantly; regardless of quickness you move in that tile right away and can act again. This makes <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> the perfect defensive tool especially when combined with skills like <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>. There are many scenarios where the difference between a great position and a compromised position is a single tile and situations where an enemy cuts off your escape route.

In addition to being a great tool for the purposes of moving that one tricky tile, it also will break the hold enemies can have on you since you can use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> even in these scenarios. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> also has an <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> prerequisite which makes it a prime candidate for <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Triple-jointed.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Triple-jointed</span></span>. Finally, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> is also a prerequisite for <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tumble.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tumble</span></span> which gives us access to +1 <span class="injected"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span><span class="stat">DV</span></span> permanently, so it's worth taking even if it wasn't already great.

## Tinkering

### Gadget Inspector

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 15 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Barathrumites (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Gadget Inspector.png" /></span><span class="skill">Gadget Inspector</span></span> will improve your ability to identify artifacts, which is pretty handy. With it, you will quite rarely fail at inspecting artifacts even with low <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span> and even on high complexity artifacts. Even more rarely will you break artifacts you try to identify. Deploying wiring is, as of now, rather useless but if you need to repair power links for gates then this is what you need.

There are several ways to learn artifact recipes that don't involve <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/DataDisk.png" /></span><span class="object">data disks</span></span>. The most well-known is <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Psychometry</span></span> which anyone can get from cooking with bananas, but you can also learn recipes from Barathrumites and Daughters of Exile you can water ritual. However, you will still need the dedicated <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span> skills in order to craft the recipes that you learn. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Gadget Inspector.png" /></span><span class="skill">Gadget Inspector</span></span> will also allow you to see what recipes are on <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/DataDisk.png" /></span><span class="object">data disks</span></span> so you can begin your collection for when you get <span class="injected"><span class="C">T</span><span class="C">i</span><span class="C">n</span><span class="C">k</span><span class="C">e</span><span class="C">r</span><span class="C"> </span><span class="C">X</span></span> skills.

In my experience, you should always save the skill points here and get this skill for reputation from the Barathrumites. Barathrumite rep is absurdly easy to get as you do tons of quests for them and you won't need the benefit from this skill until about the point you can get the skill for rep from the Barathrumites.

### Disassemble

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 15 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This is your only way of getting bits, so if you're planning on doing literally any <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span> you must have this skill. There's not much more analysis required for this one because of its necessity.

### Scavenger

<div class="section-info">

</div>

If you're planning on doing insane amounts of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span> right from the start, then this skill can see some use. However, the problem is that you don't get that many useful bits from this in the short term. Typically, there will be no shortage of artifacts that aren't of much use or are duplicates that you can <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Disassemble.png" /></span><span class="skill">Disassemble</span></span> for all the bits you really need. Again, unless you're doing some insane levels of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span> like throwing grenades for literally every enemy you find, you'll probably run into no shortage of bits. You can find some other useful stuff in the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Garbage.png" /></span><span class="object">trash</span></span> besides just scrap, but you'll probably be better off putting your skill points elsewhere.

### Lay Mine / Set Bomb

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 50sp; 17 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

You'll rarely find situations where you can actually use this skill well as places you've already been probably won't have any enemies in them and if you can get around a mine, the enemies can also probably get around the mine. You can combine this skill with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> for decent effect, but it always seems to be the case that it takes far more effort than is worth it in order for this skill to actually be effective in the way you'd expect.

While mines are mostly useless, bombs are more useful since these work on a timer; meaning that if you can plan well enough you can get your enemy in the range and not catch yourself in it as well. Again, this does take more effort than is usually worth it and so suffers from the same problem as mines. You're just going to be better off tossing the grenades right on their head. The only situation where that's not viable is with cherubim so in that particular niche you can see a bit more use out of bombs specifically.

### Repair

Another skill that while definitely has its uses is far better off being purchased for rep instead of skill points. Keep the skill points for combat effectiveness and such, by the time you need this skill you can buy it from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Yla Haj.png" /></span><span class="object">Yla Haj</span></span> in Ezra. This skill will repair both broken and rusted items, so it's definitely worth the pickup at some point just in case.

### Deploy Turret

**Worth:** Sometimes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Deploy Turret.png" /></span><span class="skill">Deploy Turret</span></span> is an interesting skill because it has a lot of potential, but needs a considerable amount of setup and support. If you have high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> (to carry weapons / ammo / cells) and the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> disarm (to get those guns back), this can be quite strong with the right setup. The downside is it leads to an (in my opinion) very boring playstyle where you secure a location, set up your killbox and then lure in enemies to be obliterated by your <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/TinkerTurret.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="c">t</span><span class="c">u</span><span class="c">r</span><span class="c">r</span><span class="c">e</span><span class="c">t</span><span class="c">s</span></span></span></span>. You can also use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Flamethrower.png" /></span><span class="object">flamethrower</span></span> / <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Freeze Ray.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="C">f</span><span class="C">r</span><span class="C">e</span><span class="C">e</span><span class="C">z</span><span class="C">e</span></span> ray</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/TinkerTurret.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="c">t</span><span class="c">u</span><span class="c">r</span><span class="c">r</span><span class="c">e</span><span class="c">t</span><span class="c">s</span></span></span></span> in order to disable your opponents. If you don't mind playing extremely slow and have the right setup for this skill, it can be pretty good. If you're not planning on playing around this skill, then you probably will find little to no use from it.

Something to note is that if you have the ability to disarm and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Electrical Generation.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Electrical Generation</span></span> or a <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/BiodynamicPowerPlant.png" /></span><span class="cybernetic"><span class="injected"><span class="Y">b</span><span class="Y">i</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="Y">d</span><span class="Y">y</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="Y">m</span><span class="Y">i</span><span class="Y">c</span><span class="Y"> </span><span class="Y">p</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="Y">w</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="Y">r</span><span class="Y"> </span><span class="Y">p</span><span class="Y">l</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="Y">n</span><span class="Y">t</span></span></span></span>, the guns you disarm from this skill will be jacked and this can be an easy way to get the mod without knowing the recipe.

Mind you, most of those items aren't that great but <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker I.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span> really isn't about the artifacts, it's about the mods. The vast majority of useful mods can be found in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker I.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span> and since the cost to get this is so cheap and the power of mods you can get so high, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker I.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span> is always useful no matter what build or style you're playing.

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker II.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinker II</span></span> is very notable for the powerful artifacts you're able to craft with it. In particular, the <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Geomagnetic Disc.png" /></span><span class="object">geomagnetic disc</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Portable Wall.png" /></span><span class="object">portable wall</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/High-Powered Magnet.png" /></span><span class="object">high-powered magnet</span></span> are all very useful items to be able to build, and while the mods aren't quite as spectacular as those in <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker I.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span>, with certain builds mods like jacked and <span class="injected"><span class="y">o</span><span class="y">v</span><span class="w">e</span><span class="W">r</span><span class="R">l</span><span class="W">o</span><span class="w">a</span><span class="y">d</span><span class="y">e</span><span class="y">d</span></span> are great and radio-powered is always a fantastic mod to get.

While this skill doesn't have quite the magnitude of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker I.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span>, the prerequisites are low enough and the benefits high enough that this is an easy pickup.

### Reverse Engineer

<div class="section-info">

**Requirements:** 100sp; 25 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span>; <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Disassemble.png" /></span><span class="skill">Disassemble</span></span>

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Reverse Engineer.png" /></span><span class="skill">Reverse Engineer</span></span> has two effects:

1. You have a 25% chance to learn to build an artifact upon disassembling it.
2. You have a 15% chance to learn a mod on an artifact upon disassembling it.

It's that second one that makes the difference here. 25 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span> is a fairly steep cost to pay, but you're quite likely to find all kinds of artifacts that you don't want anyway with a huge variety of mods. It can be endlessly frustrating to try and find the ones you want from just merchants, especially if you spawn a world with a low amount of <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/DiskMerchant.png" /></span><span class="object">schematics drafters</span></span> in the Stilt. Learning how to make an artifact is generally not helpful as artifacts you want to make in bulk you can just learn from <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Psychometry</span></span> and artifacts you want just to have you generally only need one copy and disassembling it is a huge risk. Depending on how rare that artifact is, you may just want to use <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Metamorphic Polygel.png" /></span><span class="object"><span class="injected"><span class="y">m</span><span class="y">e</span><span class="y">t</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="Y">m</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="M">r</span><span class="M">p</span><span class="M">h</span><span class="m">i</span><span class="m">c</span><span class="m"> </span><span class="m">p</span><span class="y">o</span><span class="y">l</span><span class="y">y</span><span class="Y">g</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="Y">l</span></span></span></span> instead of risking the chance to not learn the recipe.

15% chance is pretty low, but some mods can be quite common to find on items but difficult to find on merchants. Jacked is one that comes to the front of mind. Not only are you able to get any mod you'd like, but you also have the side benefit of being able to turn bits from low-value or useless artifacts / scrap into sellable artifacts for items that you _do_ want, which is extremely valuable. This skill becomes available to most builds around the time you finish Earl of Omonporch, which is also around the time you will be purchasing extremely expensive items and will want some cash to throw around.

### Tinker III

Don't get me wrong, you can build some pretty insane gear with <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker III.png" /></span><span class="skill">Tinker III</span></span> and assuming you just have it somewhat early from something like a random village, you can get some powerful artifacts (assuming you have a way of buying the right scrap for bits). Unfortunately, there is a substantial cost besides the 300 skill points which is the 29 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span> prerequisite. Since <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span> has an awful return on investment (at some point, you just have all the skills you need), investing the points all the way up to 29 to build these artifacts only slightly earlier than you could otherwise get them (since you still need the bits) just ends up not being worth it.

## Wayfaring

### Mind's Compass / Make Camp

<div class="section-info">

The obvious use of this skill is to save your sanity by making overworld travel not completely awful, but this is actually highly beneficial to your survival as you won't get lost as often in dangerous areas. While getting lost isn't an immediate death sentence, depending on your abilities, how dangerous the area is you got lost in and the look of the map you got lost in, you can be pretty dead pretty quickly with the wrong luck. This is especially true early game, so this is a must-have as soon as you start looking to leave for Grit Gate. <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Make Camp.png" /></span><span class="skill">Make Camp</span></span> comes standard on all _player_ characters, but if you've gone through permanent <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Domination</span></span> you won't have this. In this scenario, getting the first <span class="injected"><span class="icon-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Wayfaring.png" /></span><span class="skill">Wayfaring</span></span> skill becomes even more important since not being able to ease your hunger whenever you want becomes seriously annoying (believe me).

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Roots (Jungle Lore) (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

These are all really cheap skills to grab and almost every single one of them is worth it. The only exceptions are Flower Field lore, Ruins lore and Salt Dune lore. These are either too easy to walk around, not dangerous, and / or don't contain interesting locations. Jungle lore is especially good to grab just for the sheer amount of Jungle tiles on the map. The rest of the lore is super handy to find lairs in order to improve your reputation with factions like Unshelled Reptiles, Fish and Flowers as well as finding lairs with high concentrations of legendary creatures like Baboon and Goatfolk lairs. Make sure your combat build is online before grabbing these, but once you've got your core these are very nice to go into.
