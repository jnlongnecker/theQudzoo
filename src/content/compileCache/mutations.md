# Mutations

---

To preface this section, every mutation in the game can be quite useful in the right circumstances. Some mutations require significantly less investment in order to be good, so I'll be analyzing the cost of taking the mutation vs the impact that it has. I won't be judging how fun they are, I'll only be thinking about how impactful they are towards winning a run. You should note that a good build does not solely consist of the highest rated mutations, but rather a handful of typically 3-5 star mutations or potentially one or two 2 star mutations. 1 star mutations are typically just terrible and should probably be avoided. My rating will be a combination of my personal preference, how good the mutation is in a general sense (mutations that require higher levels of knowledge / specificity get a lower rating here), and how much the mutation contributes towards a winning run.

## Morphotypes

### Chimera

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Chimera.png" /></span>Chimera</span></span></span> has a very interesting gimmick associated with it. While you give up all possibility of gaining a natural mental mutation, the physical mutations you gain from spending mutation points can grow you new limbs. To be precise, when given your choice of 3 physical mutations to choose, one choice will also grow a new limb. This can be good and bad; as new limbs aren't always just a straight improvement. The only exception to this are extra hands, which are indeed just a straight improvement. Any other limb will average the <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> / <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span> bonus given from the equipment in that slot, which means you'll need to obtain more gear than normal (if you choose to grow more limbs). This results in you being incentivised to stack items that give secondary bonuses like resistances.

Is this worth giving up any possibility to gain mental mutations? On average, it tends to be. Especially if you can gain more hands, the DPS increase you can gain from <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span>Multiweapon</span> Fighting</span></span> builds skyrockets. However, you can also get unlucky and take a less-useful physical mutation for a weak limb, such as just an extra face. By the time an extra face is super impactful, you're probably at the end of the game and still an extra hand will probably be more impactful as a permanent change.

Additionally, the <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Chimera.png" /></span>Chimera</span></span></span> morphotype will provide <span class="spoiler spoiler-background" title="Spoiler: Rare liquid effect interaction" onclick="this.classList.toggle('spoiler');"><span class="spoiler-text">Spoiler: Rare liquid effect interaction</span><span class="spoiler-content">a special interaction with <span class="injected"><span class="g">b</span><span class="g">r</span><span class="g">a</span><span class="w">i</span><span class="W">n</span><span class="W"> </span><span class="W">b</span><span class="w">r</span><span class="g">i</span><span class="g">n</span><span class="g">e</span></span>, namely you gain nothing from mental mutation or mental defect rolls.</span></span>

### Esper

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 1

**Character Creation Rating:** <span class="star-filled">★ ★ </span><span class="star-empty">★ ★ ★ </span>

**Mutation Buy Rating:** N/A

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span>Esper</span></span></span> is the mental flip of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Chimera.png" /></span>Chimera</span></span></span>, only you don't gain any additional benefit. The only thing it does is restrict your options to only mental mutations. While the mental mutations are certainly powerful, they struggle in 1 very crucial aspect of the game: large groups of enemies. If you are relying on mental mutations as your sole source of damage, I'll call it what it is: a mistake. This is the trap many <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span>Espers</span></span></span> find themselves in, since they are incentivised to try and boost their <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> as much as possible to improve their plethora of mental mutations. Many physical mutations exist to improve your efficacy in melee combat, which is rather important for most of the game. Without the assistance of these physical mutations, you may find that melee combat is more dangerous than normal.

Indeed, along with the psychic glimmer your mental mutations will result in, it's actually quite a good idea to not invest too heavily in your <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> before you are at a power that defeats other <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span>Espers</span></span></span>. In the meantime, you'll need to have a strong capability in melee or ranged combat. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span>Esper</span></span></span> battles are often won not with mental mutations alone, as the other <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span>Esper</span></span></span> tends to have their own mental arsenal to counter yours.

The primary benefit of this morphotype relies heavily on random chance. You are of course more likely to roll good mutations by taking this morphotype, but not guaranteed. You can very easily find yourself with your choice of only weak mental mutations and find yourself significantly underprepared for the challenges ahead of you and especially for battles against other <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span>Espers</span></span></span>. At the same time, you can find incredible mutations and quickly find yourself a psychic monster.

### Unstable Genome

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 3

**Character Creation Rating:** <span class="star-filled">★ ★ </span><span class="star-empty">★ ★ ★ </span>

**Mutation Buy Rating:** N/A

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Unstable Genome.png" /></span>Unstable</span> Genome</span></span> leaves your entire build to chance. You can take it several times and just see what you end up with, or if you don't know what to take or aren't super satisfied with your choices of mutation for 3 mutation points, you can put those points into <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Unstable Genome.png" /></span>Unstable</span> Genome</span></span> and see what you get. While you _could_ get something quite good, like <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Legs.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Legs</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span>Precognition</span></span></span>, you could just as well get something not worth the points, like <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Teleport Other.png" /></span>Teleport</span> Other</span></span>. This is not to portray this mutation as only giving you one choice, you get the choice of 3; it's just to illustrate that you may not get something good by taking this.

Since this leaves so much up to chance, I can't rate it too high but you can get some absolutely incredible builds if you get lucky.

## Physical Mutations

### Adrenal Control

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 4

**Character Creation Rating:** <span class="star-filled">★ </span><span class="star-empty">★ ★ ★ ★ </span>

**Mutation Buy Rating:** <span class="star-filled">★ </span><span class="star-empty">★ ★ ★ ★ </span>

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Adrenal Control.png" /></span>Adrenal</span> Control</span></span> has a bizarre opportunity cost. Taking <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Adrenal Control.png" /></span>Adrenal</span> Control</span></span> requires you to invest mutation points into it for it to be of any use at all. Doing so implicitly will lower the amount of points you can invest in your other mutations. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Adrenal Control.png" /></span>Adrenal</span> Control</span></span> will boost those other mutations, but only if they're physical mutations. At typical max rank of physical mutations, 10, this bonus is a +4. If we instead did not take this mutation and spent all the mutation points elsewhere, we would have a useful maxed mutation or a mutation that requires no investment and 2 mutations at +5 each _permanently_. Now you might counter and say that if you have tons of physical mutations, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Adrenal Control.png" /></span>Adrenal</span> Control</span></span> will boost all of them. And I would say yes, that's true. But that also costs 4 mutation points every time you want to buy a new mutation, and these mutations only go up to rank 5 with a maxed <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Adrenal Control.png" /></span>Adrenal</span> Control</span></span>. Some of those mutations may not even get much benefit from such an increase, such as <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Arms.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Arms</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burrowing Claws.png" /></span>Burrowing</span> Claws</span></span>.

Now comes the silver bullet: <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Adrenal Control.png" /></span>Adrenal</span> Control</span></span> only lasts 20 turns, and then goes on a massive cooldown. This is just not worth it in nearly any capacity. The last benefit of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Adrenal Control.png" /></span>Adrenal</span> Control</span></span> is the quickness, but this is marginally better than rank 1 <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Quickness.png" /></span>Heightened</span> Quickness</span></span> at rank 10 <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Adrenal Control.png" /></span>Adrenal</span> Control</span></span> and quickly gets outscaled. We have better options.

### Beak

**Mutation Buy Rating:** N/A

</div>

Stats are always useful in any run. <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> is handy in affording items, but is particularly useful if you're looking to gain a few mental mutations. You won't be barred from equipping any face slot items, and you have a 20% chance of dealing a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Glowcrow_Peck.png" /></span>peck</span></span></span> attack that deals 1 damage per penetration. The <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Glowcrow_Peck.png" /></span>peck</span></span></span> is pretty useless, but the <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> is nice for 1 mutation point. If you're looking to do more mental mutations, this is a pretty handy 1 MP option. Bird rep is pretty useless since you start neutral and birds are very non-threatening (except <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Dawnglider.png" /></span>dawngliders</span></span></span>, but you need Unshelled Reptile reputation as well).

### Burrowing Claws

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burrowing Claws.png" /></span>Burrowing</span> Claws</span></span> are interesting because they can be used with or without any investment. If you don't invest into them, then they just become a more convenient way of breaking through walls since you don't have to swap to a digging tool (or get / carry one around) for most of the game. The uninvested <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burrowing Claws.png" /></span>Burrowing</span> Claws</span></span> are therefore a mild convenience as opposed to something that really impacts your run in a significant way, so why rate them as highly as I do?

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burrowing Claws.png" /></span>Burrowing</span> Claws</span></span> are natural, <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span>Short</span> Blade</span></span> weapons. This means that they have an uncapped penetration value and benefit from <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span>Short</span> Blade</span></span> skills; meaning that going a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span>Multiweapon</span> Fighting</span></span> build can be highly synergistic with your mutation. Now, if you invest in <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burrowing Claws.png" /></span>Burrowing</span> Claws</span></span> and build around them to have incredibly high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength"><span class="nowrap">Strength</span></span></span>, you can dish out an incredible amount of damage; even though the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Burrowing Claws.png" /></span>burrowing</span> claws</span></span> will simply never catch up to the damage of the highest tier daggers they will still outpace their damage if you can make use of the uncapped penetration. In addition to this, you absolutely shred apart walls; so fast in fact that you can use this while in combat to morph the terrain in your favor and draw the enemy into 1-on-1 matchups. Even still, they require a considerable amount of investment, and if your build does not revolve around them, you're better off just leaving them unranked.

### Carapace

<div class="section-info">

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span> is an incredibly powerful mutation. It's so good that it's comical that it costs less than the likes of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Adrenal Control.png" /></span>Adrenal</span> Control</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Flaming Ray.png" /></span>Flaming</span> Ray</span></span> / <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Freezing Ray.png" /></span>Freezing</span> Ray</span></span>. The only downside of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span> is that if you take it at all, you _must_ invest heavily into it; which can pigeonhole you into a build you weren't originally going for (which is why it only gets 4 stars on the Mutation Buy Rating). On the upside, that build is nearly guaranteed to be extremely good.

At rank 10, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span> is simply a better version of the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Zetachrome Lune.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="m">z</span><span class="M">e</span><span class="Y">t</span><span class="C">a</span><span class="c">c</span><span class="c">h</span><span class="C">r</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="M">m</span><span class="m">e</span></span></span> lune</span></span>. With modding, you can make the lune marginally better in defensive stats, but that of course requires you to find it first. You can have <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span> at rank 10 as early as level 20; around the time you get to Bethesda Susa. Not only do you get the defensive stats, but you also get an incredible amount of heat and cold resistance. Where <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span> gets truly insane is when you rapidly advance it to bring it past rank 10. With two rapid advancements, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span> becomes far better than any armor could hope to be: 85 cold and heat resistance and 11 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> at the cost of -2 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span>. With the <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weathered.png" /></span>Weathered</span></span></span> skill, this makes you immune to all cold and heat damage. This of course requires a lot of investment, but is absolutely worth it. While tightening your shell can be handy in niche scenarios or when combined with mental mutations, most of your time won't be spent using that but at very high <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> totals (like with rank 16 <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span>), you can become practically immune to physical attacks while tightened.

Just to put in perspective, with the best <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> equipment in the game and rank 16 <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span>, you can have 28 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> _without_ a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span>Shield</span></span></span>; which is enough to protect perfectly from any attack except for the most powerful of attackers like <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Saltwurm.png" /></span>salt</span> kraken</span></span> and some types of cherubim. If we tighten our <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span>, that puts us at 39 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span>, again _without a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span>Shield</span></span></span>_. Supplement this with <span class="spoiler spoiler-background" title="Spoiler: Rare liquid effect" onclick="this.classList.toggle('spoiler');"><span class="spoiler-text">Spoiler: Rare liquid effect</span><span class="spoiler-content"><span class="injected"><span class="B">n</span><span class="b">e</span><span class="K">u</span><span class="y">t</span><span class="Y">r</span><span class="B">o</span><span class="b">n</span><span class="K"> </span><span class="y">f</span><span class="Y">l</span><span class="B">u</span><span class="b">x</span></span></span></span> and the <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Calloused.png" /></span>Calloused</span></span></span> skill and you can reach some truly frightening levels of durability.

Now, a lot of this analysis looks at <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span> at the higher echelon; but how does it fare throughout the game? While you may initially think that you should build your equipment around <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span> actually works better by building <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span>. The -2 from <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span> can easily be overcome by heavily investing in <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span>, and since the <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> bonus is so high from <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span> we can have strong <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span>. Once we get strong enough <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> items, we can then swap over to an <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> build. Also, being neutral to <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/IrritableTortoise.png" /></span>irritable</span> tortoises</span></span> is pretty cool too.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span>Corrosive</span> Gas Generation</span></span> is incredibly highly damaging and very useful, and benefits from having a damage type (acid) that is only resisted by very few rare and/or very avoidable enemies. It will hang around for a while, which means at low enough cooldown you can _really_ stack up the density and therefore the damage. This allows you to lure in enemies from around the map and annihilate them with ease. However, this applies also to non-enemies or allies; you can easily do significant collateral damage which requires an extra layer of care if that matters to you.

There were some changes to the way enemy AI interacts with the player surrounded by gas; they are now much less afraid of charging into the gas to get at you if they are melee based. While this is great for when you rank up the mutation, it means that <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span>Corrosive</span> Gas Generation</span></span> no longer keeps enemies at bay even at rank 1. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span>Corrosive</span> Gas Generation</span></span> demands your mutation points, but it doesn't really need to be too greedy about them. If you are capable of surviving in melee for prolonged periods of time, the damage from the gas will simply stack up enough to kill whatever you are fighting.

The gas is very difficult to control as it will spread in unpredictable ways. You can mitigate some of this if you have enough intuition about how gas density and diffusion mechanics work, but even then the best of us can only make an educated guess. This is important as the gas will rapidly destroy any wall it comes in contact with, which can be both convenient and really bad. You must take care to only start using your gas when walls are no longer necessary to your survival, which does take experience to understand. Despite this, it is a powerful enough mutation to not matter in a large portion of circumstances.

Even without any investment, a +2 to <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength"><span class="nowrap">Strength</span></span></span> is already pretty worth it. With investment, we can get even higher <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength"><span class="nowrap">Strength</span></span></span> which allows us to focus our attribute points elsewhere while keeping the highest penetration value possible for our weapons. We can combine this with weapons that have no penetration cap, like <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span>Horns</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burrowing Claws.png" /></span>Burrowing</span> Claws</span></span> to devastating effect. Where <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Double-muscled.png" /></span>Double-muscled</span></span></span> propels itself ahead of most mutations is its capability to stun on melee attacks that penetrate as well. Combine this with a build that makes as many attacks as possible and you can easily stun enemies near permanently. This mutation is a staple in most of my builds; you become far more effective in melee with it and a before and after comparison between having it and not having it is quite noticeable.

Something relevant to note is that the daze chance from <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Double-muscled.png" /></span>Double-muscled</span></span></span> is a bit of a special case. It is completely separate from other daze chances, like <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Bludgeon.png" /></span>Bludgeon</span></span></span>, and can proc in the same attack as another daze chance (resulting in an immediate stun). Additionally, this chance is _not_ affected by <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Precision Nanon Fingers.png" /></span>precision</span> <span class="injected"><span class="Y">nanon</span></span> fingers</span></span>.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Electrical Generation.png" /></span>Electrical</span> Generation</span></span> is VERY good, but it is an expensive mutation to take in character creation. It can deal a great amount of damage when you drink energy from cells to spam it, and it synergizes extremely well with higher quickness and movement speed as the recharge occurs every time you make a move, instead of the time frame of a normal "turn" like what normal cooldowns use. This makes the "cooldown" of using <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Electrical Generation.png" /></span>Electrical</span> Generation</span></span> improve with action speed instead of <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower"><span class="nowrap">Willpower</span></span></span>. This also provides an exceptional power source for jacked modded items, which can be attained even without <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker II.png" /></span>Tinker</span> II</span></span> by disarming <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/TinkerTurret.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="c">turrets</span></span></span></span></span>. With the capability of modding (or just being very lucky), we can create jacked <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Force Bracelet.png" /></span>force</span> bracelets</span></span> for infinite uptime on the forcefield.

The downside to this mutation is that it requires investment, and requires more investment the more your build relies on jacked items and its damage. Electric damage is great in many instances, as enemies tend to have very low (or even negative) electrical resistance, but can be inconvenient as it can arc to our allies and cause creatures to be angry with us; so we need to be careful when using this mutation for damage.

In order to have any significant range or duration, we need pretty heavy investment in this mutation. The mutation is also _only_ effective against robots, the reflective shield, and artifacts. Robots, fair enough; it gives quite a few turns to work at the higher tiers. The reflective shield is pointless, since you need to get close to use the mutation but lowering the shield just lets you use ranged weapons; which you can't use as effectively now because you had to get close to use the mutation. Finally, very few enemies actually use weapons that are weak to EMP; and those that do are not very threatening at all. The only exception to this are the templar, which are quite rare outside of the A Call to Arms quest. It is not useful in the early game at all, and requires you to be investing in it so that when you finally do face an enemy where it will be useful, it can actually be effective.

All of this to be outclassed by <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker I.png" /></span>Tinker</span> I</span></span> and the ability to craft EMP grenades, which you can attain for a grand total of 100 skill points (you can get <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span>Tinkering</span></span></span> for Barathrumites reputation). While they don't last quite as long, they're dirt cheap to tinker and can be thrown, and more importantly don't cost any mutation points and you're probably going to want <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinker I.png" /></span>Tinker</span> I</span></span> anyways for all the vast benefits this gives you. With <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> available in the ovens of Ezra, if you have 1 EMP grenade you can easily learn the recipe for mass-production.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Flaming Ray.png" /></span>Flaming</span> Ray</span></span>, with investment, becomes a pretty decent damage option for a while. It's another mutation that _requires_ investment, so if you pick this mutation up you'll need to rank it up for it to be any good at all. Unfortunately for it, being that it is an elemental damage mutation it needs to compare with the likes of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Electrical Generation.png" /></span>Electrical</span> Generation</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span>Corrosive</span> Gas Generation</span></span>, which it does struggle to do. It has a remarkably low cooldown, which means it is very spammable and does do respectable damage, just not to the degree that <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span>Corrosive</span> Gas Generation</span></span> does.

It can be used to evaporate liquids (with enough ranks and patience) and synergizes well with flaming modded items. It's cool and handy early, but a considerable number of enemies in the mid-late game have fairly decent heat resistance; robots in particular. Because of this, heat damage just isn't quite as useful as electric or acid damage and creatures can cool themselves down more easily than they can warm themselves up by patting out flames. Or, they can just stay on fire and continue to hit you; which will cause you to deal more damage to them but dealing more damage is never as good as taking no damage yourself; and <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Flaming Ray.png" /></span>Flaming</span> Ray</span></span> doesn't get you to that point enough to rate it much higher, especially for 4 mutation points and the investment required.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Freezing Ray.png" /></span>Freezing</span> Ray</span></span> is the cold equivalent of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Flaming Ray.png" /></span>Flaming</span> Ray</span></span>, which immediately makes it slightly better (but only slightly). It does less damage, and the temperature change is rather pitiful so creatures won't remain frozen for long or perhaps even at all. Despite this, it makes _you_ harder to freeze, which is really the main reason to take this mutation. Because of this, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Freezing Ray.png" /></span>Freezing</span> Ray</span></span> is actually useful without any investment at all. If you want to be able to freeze anything, you'll need to invest heavily; just like <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Flaming Ray.png" /></span>Flaming</span> Ray</span></span>. But if you just want to be practically immune to freeze, just take it and enjoy your enhanced freeze point.

If you are interested in trying to permanently freeze creatures, combining this mutation with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Double-muscled.png" /></span>Double-muscled</span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Arms.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Arms</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span>Multiweapon</span> Fighting</span></span> with <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span>Cudgels</span></span></span> can be a rather devastating lockdown build. The specificity is quite high, however, and it doesn't really get to the point of being foolproof so care is still necessary. While it does have more utility than <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Flaming Ray.png" /></span>Flaming</span> Ray</span></span>, it unfortunately is so costly at character creation that it doesn't quite stack up in that rating.

For the cost of the mutation, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Hearing.png" /></span>Heightened</span> Hearing</span></span> is unbelievably good. It's even good without any investment, as it allows you to "see" enemies past walls, and the higher you rank it the more omniscient you become. High rank <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Hearing.png" /></span>Heightened</span> Hearing</span></span> means you will never be surprised about any enemy ever again, and the fact that it's always active means you can passively enjoy its benefit.

However, for these exact reasons, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Hearing.png" /></span>Heightened</span> Hearing</span></span> is also incredibly annoying. The higher rank it is, the more annoying it gets to move through the map quickly. Since you're always aware of where enemies are, you'll be prevented from using your automation (autoexplore, autowalk, rest, <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Disassemble.png" /></span>Disassemble</span></span></span> all, gather, etc) while an enemy is perceived in your set radius. And you don't want to turn off that radius because in many cases you still do want to be stopped when an enemy is nearby. Because of that, I can't give it a perfect score.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Quickness.png" /></span>Heightened</span> Quickness</span></span> is a mutation that scales unusually; as it gives heavily diminishing returns the more you invest into it. Base-rank, it's already good and worth the mutation points, as quickness is massively important and hard to get. However, ranking up the mutation only gives an extra 2 quickness per rank; so at some point it's not really doing much to continue pouring mutation points into it.

This is both good and bad, since if you _know_ when to stop, you save on mutation points that can go elsewhere. But if you _don't_, this mutation can be a dump of mutation points that don't offer much more benefit. A good rule of thumb: I tend to rank this up to rank 6, which gives me +25 quickness. This hits the threshold of making me act twice every 4 turns. If I combine this with bonuses from sunslag, I can then hit the threshold of acting twice every 3 turns.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span>Horns</span></span></span> try to be a more offensive version of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span>, and they succeed pretty well. Like <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span>, if you take <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span>Horns</span></span></span> you are now forced to build around them or at least invest into them. These deal very high damage, especially when invested in, and cause one of the most deadly bleeds in the game. They even have the added benefit of giving an enhanced chance to hit with all attacks made with them, so you will practically never miss even with low <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility"><span class="nowrap">Agility</span></span></span>. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span>Horns</span></span></span> are so powerful in fact that you'll probably want to use them as your primary weapon, and even if you don't, they will _always_ strike on a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span>Charge</span></span></span> making that skill even better than it already is.

Now, the problem with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span>Horns</span></span></span> is that you must now play a melee <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength"><span class="nowrap">Strength</span></span></span> build in order to get proper efficacy from them. If you don't, then the armor they provide is simply not worth the investment you must put into them as you cannot mod the <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span>Horns</span></span></span>. Helmets have some of the most useful mods, and <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span>Horns</span></span></span> having no defensive benefits besides the <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> means not being able to use helmets is actually something significant we're missing out on. For this reason, if you do not have a build that already can utilize <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span>Horns</span></span></span> well, you'll probably not want to take it.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Horns.png" /></span>Horns</span></span></span> also come in at a relatively steep cost of 4 mutation points on character creation, which when compared to other offensive mutations such as <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span>Sunder</span> Mind</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span>Corrosive</span> Gas Generation</span></span> is not quite as good. It's _the_ de-facto offensive melee mutation, but while it is a cut above the melee weapons you will find it is not so significant to completely warrant the cost.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Arms.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Arms</span></span> does what it says on the tin: you grow 2 extra arms with this mutation. This will give you 2 hand slots, 2 arm slots and another worn on hands slot. Early game, this will be slightly annoying as you'll need to have extra gloves to wear. Midgame and later, it becomes a blessing as you can stack the side effects of higher tier gloves and their mods, and it's the same story with the arm slots. Based on your mutation rank, you will have a different baseline chance to strike with your mutated hands from your natural hands. This starts off quite low (10%), and increases to 37% by rank 10. In order to break the 50% threshold, you'll need 2 rapid advancements, putting your chance to strike at rank 16 at 55%.

Now, these odds aren't great. In fact, they're pretty bad. In fact, they're really bad. However, this is not where the story ends with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Arms.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Arms</span></span>. These percentages are your _baseline_ chances to strike, which means that all the <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span>Multiweapon</span> Fighting</span></span> skills _add on top of this percentage_. With <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Mastery.png" /></span>Multiweapon</span> Mastery</span></span>, you can throw on an additional 50% to your chance to strike. This means if you dump on those two rapid advancements to bring the mutation to rank 16, you can get above 100% chance to strike with your offhand attacks. Throw on <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span>Jab</span></span></span> and this means your <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span>Short</span> Blades</span></span> are guaranteed to strike twice every time. This can be very powerful, but is a **very** steep investment. Generally speaking, there are other damage mutations with a bit better return on investment.

As an alternative to dumping huge amounts of mutation points, you can instead put in none. That's right, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Arms.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Arms</span></span> is a mutation you can easily leave at rank 1. That is because even at rank 1, you can still enjoy massive power from the mutation. You could also just put a single point into the mutation which would bring the strike chance with the mutated arms slightly above the natural chance (15% vs 17%). There are 2 configurations to squeeze the most out of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Arms.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Arms</span></span>.

The first configuration is <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span>Multiweapon</span> Fighting</span></span> with two-handed weapons. <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Axe.png" /></span>Axes</span></span></span> in particular work very well with this, as <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span>Dismembering</span></span></span> chance doubles on two-handed weapons. When you use a two-handed weapon, what determines your chance to hit is the primary hand that is holding the weapon. This is the hand that has the weapon name with its normal text color, while the secondary hand has the weapon name grayed out. So, if you use your non-mutated hands as the main hands holding your two-handed weapons, then you'll benefit from all the <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span>Multiweapon</span> Fighting</span></span> skills making your maximum chance to hit with your offhand weapon 65%. This results in more DPS than rank 16 <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Arms.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Arms</span></span> and 4 one-handed weapons (except when those mutated hands are holding <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span>Short</span> Blades</span></span> with <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jab.png" /></span>Jab</span></span></span> and the non-mutated hands are holding a two-handed weapon). We can force the hands that hold the two-handed weapon by filling all other hands with one-handed items and then equipping the two-handed weapon in the primary hand we want to hold it. The game will automatically use empty hands to hold the two-handed weapon before trying to unequip one of your other weapons.

The second configuration is a two-handed weapon, an offhand dagger and a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span>Shield</span></span></span> in the last mutated hand.

Since we're not using a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span>Shield</span></span></span> for its damage, it has full effectiveness in the mutated arm (we could also do this to wield two <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span>Shields</span></span></span>, but I tend to prefer the extra damage from the two-handed weapon instead since two <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span>Shields</span></span></span> only benefits you with <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Swift Blocking.png" /></span>Swift</span> Blocking</span></span> and when taking 3+ hits in a round). Then we use a dagger in our natural offhand, as <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span>Multiweapon</span> Fighting</span></span> with a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Short Blade.png" /></span>Short</span> Blade</span></span> deals far more damage than <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Multiweapon Fighting.png" /></span>Multiweapon</span> Fighting</span></span> with any other class of weapon. This configuration is only marginally inferior to the first in terms of damage, but has the additional benefit of a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Shield.png" /></span>Shield</span></span></span>.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Legs.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Legs</span></span> seems like a considerable investment for a rather underwhelming benefit when you read the description of it during character creation. Indeed, I was rather unimpressed by this mutation for a long time and never took it, but I am here before you today to claim this mutation as one of the best in the game. The only thing holding this mutation back is the massive cost during character creation, but even then it's still worth it.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Legs.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Legs</span></span> gives you bonus movement speed and some extra carrying capacity. The carrying capacity is convenient, and just the extra sauce on top. What we really want this mutation for is the movement speed, because it's absolutely _massive_. Unlike <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Arms.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Arms</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Legs.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Legs</span></span> hungers for investment. While taking it does absolutely require you to invest, you are so **heavily** rewarded for doing so that it's worth every point. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Legs.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Legs</span></span> is one of the best mutations to invest a rapid advancement or two into, since you can even gain over 300 bonus movement speed from two rapid advancements. This means you move **4** times for every move an enemy makes; this is unbelievable. And it only gets better when you improve it with your boot slots (of which you have 2 now) and the mods you can put on these.

If you are at all interested in ranged combat, this mutation should be at the top of your list. With it, you can reliably kite any enemy in the game throughout the entire game as long as you keep investing into it.

Now, by gaining all this movement speed we have a secondary synergy in perhaps the most unusual place: <span class="injected"><span class="K">I</span><span class="y">r</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="y">n</span><span class="K">s</span><span class="y">h</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="y">n</span><span class="K">k</span></span>. Normally, <span class="injected"><span class="K">i</span><span class="y">r</span><span class="Y">o</span><span class="y">n</span><span class="K">s</span><span class="y">h</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="y">n</span><span class="K">k</span></span> is very bad since it will slow you to a crawl at its final stage (-80 movement speed). This doesn't come without a benefit, as you _do_ gain 5 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> for your trouble. Normally, this is not worth it in any way. However, with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Legs.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Legs</span></span> we laugh at losing a mere 80 movement speed. Reducing you from moving 4 times per turn to 3 times per turn is not a big loss, and having a free extra 5 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> is a significant boon. We can obtain this synergy as early as Golgotha; so slap on your <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Legs.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Legs</span></span> and sip on that black ooze for a very powerful synergy.

Hot take, but <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Night Vision.png" /></span>Night</span> Vision</span></span> is a bit overrated as a mutation. It can't be upgraded, and its range is quite poor. In fact, as soon as you get a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Glowsphere.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="Y">glowsphere</span></span></span></span></span> the vision it gives you is outclassed. Having to hold an item in your offhand means you can only use a single one-handed weapon, which is pretty inconvenient admittedly. However, you're not really hurting for killing power in the early game, even with a single one-handed weapon. By the time it starts to hold back your damage, you'll have found a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Floating Glowsphere.png" /></span>floating</span> <span class="injected"><span class="Y">glowsphere</span></span></span></span>. While this will prevent you from using a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Hoversled.png" /></span>hoversled</span></span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Light-Obfuscating Lens.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="K">l</span><span class="Y">i</span><span class="K">g</span><span class="K">h</span><span class="Y">t</span><span class="K">-</span><span class="K">o</span><span class="Y">b</span><span class="K">f</span><span class="K">u</span><span class="Y">s</span><span class="K">c</span><span class="K">a</span><span class="Y">t</span><span class="K">i</span><span class="K">n</span><span class="Y">g</span></span></span> lens</span></span>, better inventory management solves the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Hoversled.png" /></span>hoversled</span></span></span> need and 1 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span> is nice but not the worst thing to miss out on (especially if you're building on <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span>). Then you get a guaranteed <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Quantum Mote.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="q">q</span><span class="u">u</span><span class="a">a</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="t">t</span><span class="u">u</span><span class="m">m</span><span class="m"></span> </span><span class="m">m</span><span class="m">o</span><span class="m">t</span><span class="m">e</span></span></span></span> from <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Barathrum.png" /></span>Barathrum</span></span></span> for light _and_ 1 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span>; an item so good you'll probably be using it even if you have <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Night Vision.png" /></span>Night</span> Vision</span></span>. I will give credit where it's due, it is one of the few ways <span class="spoiler spoiler-background" title="Spoiler: Mid game boss" onclick="this.classList.toggle('spoiler');"><span class="spoiler-text">Spoiler: Mid game boss</span><span class="spoiler-content">to reveal <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span>Haggabah</span></span></span></span></span> so in that way it's useful but that's a single enemy that can be beaten in other ways.

Is it useful? Yes, for 1 MP it's one of the better options for that cost. Is it worth downgrading your build over to fit it in? Not at all.

### Phasing

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span>Phasing</span></span></span> is one of the most pathetically scaling mutations in the game. Each rank, you get just 1 (one!) more turn of being phased. It also has anti-synergies as well in the very good mutations <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Quickness.png" /></span>Heightened</span> Quickness</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Legs.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Legs</span></span> because each turn of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span>Phasing</span></span></span> only counts **your** turn. Meaning the faster you make your moves, the less actual turns you spend phased.

Despite all this, it is _still_ an incredibly powerful mutation absolutely worth taking. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span>Phasing</span></span></span> is the (near) perfect defensive mutation; not only can you escape from the overwhelming majority of threats with it, but you can also bait attacks and improve your map mobility by bypassing hazards. With heavy investment and phase cooking effects you can remain phased for long periods of time (practically endlessly), and combine this with phase-harmonic / phase-conjugate gear and you can rain death upon the enemy from perfect safety. With <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Harvestry.png" /></span>Harvestry</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Spinnerets.png" /></span>Spinnerets</span></span></span>, you can farm infinite phase silk to sell for money, or you can cook with it to gain extra phase time. With <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span>Corrosive</span> Gas Generation</span></span>, you can phase out, spew your stink, and then phase in to dunk your gas cloud on enemies (they won't try and avoid the gas while it's phased out).

Alternatively, you can keep it at rank 1 and just use it as an emergency panic button. If you get grabbed or cornered, you can make it back to safety with full control over where you end up. If you get blocked in by force fields, you can pass right through them.

Despite how good it is, the anti-synergies and the fact you can gain this mutation through cooking effects makes me unable to rate it perfectly; but you will not be disappointed by this mutation.

### Photosynthetic Skin

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Photosynthetic Skin.png" /></span>Photosynthetic</span> Skin</span></span> is like a conditional <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Quickness.png" /></span>Heightened</span> Quickness</span></span> that also gives regeneration speed. This regen is only effective outside of combat; so it's really more of a convenience than anything else and I'll instead be focusing on the other aspects of this mutation, however I should still mention that with the <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Regeneration.png" /></span>Regeneration</span></span></span> mutation this regen will apply _in_ combat as well. This mutation gives the exact same quickness at every rank that <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Quickness.png" /></span>Heightened</span> Quickness</span></span> does. This makes it synergize quite well with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Quickness.png" /></span>Heightened</span> Quickness</span></span>, and is also advised to take this mutation to at least rank 6. If you want to rapidly advance this mutation, you should only do so once as doing so twice is not as effective (doesn't break into the 5 day duration or past the 50 quickness threshold). So, what gives? It does the same thing as <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Quickness.png" /></span>Heightened</span> Quickness</span></span>, plus a bit more and it's not rated quite as well. How come?

This is because <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Photosynthetic Skin.png" /></span>Photosynthetic</span> Skin</span></span> has a few disadvantages that come with it that <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Quickness.png" /></span>Heightened</span> Quickness</span></span> doesn't suffer, and the added regen isn't very significant to the success of the run. Namely, you take massive damage from defoliant, you don't bleed blood, and you have to constantly refresh your quickness buff specifically on the surface in daytime. Bleeding sap can cause both you and your enemy to get stuck in it, which can be beneficial or catastrophic rarely. More often, it just means you can't fill <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Biodynamic Cell.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="r">biodynamic</span></span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="c">cells</span></span></span></span> from yourself. Taking damage from defoliant is pretty awful, as usually this is a gas you simply ignore and laugh at enemies for wasting upon you and this mutation doesn't grant you any protection from a different gas in exchange. During long dungeons, your quickness buff will fall off meaning you will have to cook with the starch generated by walking in the sun to refresh your quickness buff. If you run out of these, you'll have to go back up to the surface. Additionally, you won't be able to benefit from any cooking effects while the quickness and / or regeneration buff is active, since it's a metabolizing effect.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Photosynthetic Skin.png" /></span>Photosynthetic</span> Skin</span></span> is also unique in that it benefits from <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Self-discipline.png" /></span>Self-discipline</span></span></span> skills to lower your hunger rate, letting you enjoy the metabolizing buff for longer. Additionally, the reputation for vines, flowers, roots and the Consortium of Phyta are all pretty nice, especially the Phyta rep since it will easily allow you to get the <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Snake Oiler.png" /></span>Snake</span> Oiler</span></span> perk right away. All-in-all, if you're not interested in cooking effects or willing to sacrifice them, this mutation is nearly as powerful as <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Heightened Quickness.png" /></span>Heightened</span> Quickness</span></span>.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Quills.png" /></span>Quills</span></span></span> tries to be an offensive version of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span> and absolutely fails. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Quills.png" /></span>Quills</span></span></span> provide damage reflection, but the amount isn't particularly significant (3%) and only works with melee attacks. Not only is the amount insignificant, but it _reduces_ the number of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Quills.png" /></span>Quills</span></span></span> you have, which reduces the efficacy of the mutation. The <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> it provides is poor and bars you from being able to wear any armor yourself, which removes your opportunity of wearing better <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span> armor in its place OR benefiting from any body armor mods. The gimmick of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Quills.png" /></span>Quills</span></span></span> is that you can fling some of your <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Quills.png" /></span>Quills</span></span></span> to deal damage to everything around you. While these ignore accuracy, their max penetration value is abysmal (6) which makes this option (even if you wanted to use it) rather ineffective regardless of mutation rank starting in the midgame. It doesn't start at 6, mind you, it starts at 0 and by rank 10 is only 4.

In case it wasn't bad enough, quill fling uses 10% of your _current_ <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Quills.png" /></span>Quills</span></span></span>, which makes it weaker and weaker every time you use it. Additionally, you're actually _penalized_ for using your quill fling because when you lose half your <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Quills.png" /></span>Quills</span></span></span>, you lose half your <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> bonus from the mutation as well. If the hole isn't deep enough for you to bury this one, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Quills.png" /></span>Quills</span></span></span> gets a _variable quill increase every rank_. This means that you can have two characters with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Quills.png" /></span>Quills</span></span></span> at the same rank, and one could have less <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Quills.png" /></span>Quills</span></span></span> than the other, making it weaker. Why the devs decided to introduce RNG into an already weak mutation, I have no idea.

Despite all this, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Quills.png" /></span>Quills</span></span></span> can be effective in the early to mid game. It requires significant investment in order to do so, and becomes ineffective during the late game. Any enemy with 8 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> or more will take practically no damage from quill fling, and this is most of the enemies past level 30. Against the most dangerous enemies, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Quills.png" /></span>Quills</span></span></span> becomes an active negative because it takes the spot of more effective armor. It's rated as high as it is because it can carry you for a while, but when it falls off it falls off **hard**.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Regeneration.png" /></span>Regeneration</span></span></span> is an interesting mutation, as it becomes less useful the more you know about the game. For a novice player, it's a very good mutation; a lifesaver even. It will prevent many debilitating effects even at rank 1, and dismemberment can be catastrophic to a newer player. However, once you learn the enemies that are capable of <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span>Dismembering</span></span></span> and the alternatives to solving this, you find that you rarely if ever get <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Dismember.png" /></span>Dismembered</span></span></span> at all. And when you do, you can get it fixed fairly trivially. It still stays handy for its capability to remove minor and (at rank 5+) major effects, but once again the more you learn about the game the better you get at avoiding these effects in the first place. Rank 10 provides you immunity to decapitation, but if you know what _can_ decapitate you then it's quite easy to not be decapitated. Creatures capable of this are very rare, so this is not a feature that is particularly exciting.

Despite this, it is quite handy for fixing minor mistakes and for the combat regeneration you get for extended fights. When combined with the massive extra regen speed from <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Photosynthetic Skin.png" /></span>Photosynthetic</span> Skin</span></span>, a high <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> build can become extremely difficult to kill outside of creatures that hard-counter <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> builds. While it's not a mutation I tend to start with, it's still a good pickup if there's nothing crazy in the mutation buy.

This mutation doesn't need to be ranked up too much to still be really good. While it doesn't work on robots, against anything else it will ensure it either doesn't get close to you or becomes sleeping beauty if it does. Enemies that you're currently fighting will have to fight through constantly being put to sleep, which leaves them dazed when they awaken and provides a massive +4 <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv"><span class="nowrap">PV</span></span></span> bonus to the attacker and -12 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span> penalty to the snoozer. Unlike <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span>Corrosive</span> Gas Generation</span></span>, it doesn't destroy your valuable walls for protection and while it doesn't do damage, it keeps you alive which tends to be more valuable. A very good mutation, not much more to say.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Slime Glands.png" /></span>Slime</span> Glands</span></span> are kinda cool, they let you walk safely on slime and you can dilute dangerous liquids with the slime you spit. You can also use this to influence where enemies walk but enemies will still walk through slime if they must to attack you. Slime does retain heat better and dilutes blood from warming up an enemy if you're planning on keeping them frozen, so slobbering on enemies you want ice cubed can be a useful strategy. If you've got the extra point lying around, go ahead but the other 1 MP options are probably better.

### Spinnerets

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Spinnerets.png" /></span>Spinnerets</span></span></span> is a very specific mutation that really struggles being used in any way other than to cover your retreat. <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span>Sprint</span></span></span> tends to be more than sufficient in building the gap between you and the enemy for you to escape anyway, and if there's more room than a 1 tile corridor, the enemy can simply walk around it. You can use this to draw enemies in by getting in melee with them, then activating <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Spinnerets.png" /></span>Spinnerets</span></span></span> and moving back. All this really accomplishes is making them easier to hit or providing some gap for you to use ranged weapons against them. Once they break free, you have to do this again and any enemies behind them won't suffer the same fate, so you can really only do this a limited number of times before you run out of space.

Perhaps the biggest benefit is that you no longer become stuck by webs or liquids like sap or asphalt once you have this mutation, making it useful even at rank 1. Additionally, with the <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Harvestry.png" /></span>Harvestry</span></span></span> skill and some form of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span>Phasing</span></span></span>, you're able to infinitely farm phase silk. This makes it quite easy to get infinite money or the ingredients for improved <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span>Phasing</span></span></span>. The Arachnid rep is kinda cool since it makes you neutral, but Arachnids are one of the least threatening factions so it's nothing crazy. An OK mutation, but there's probably better choices. Take it if you really want to all-in on <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span>Phasing</span></span></span>.

### Stinger (Confusing Venom)

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span>Stinger</span></span></span> comes in 3 flavors of venom: confusing, poisoning and paralyzing. The only difference between all 3 are the effects of the venom, so we'll only cover the alternate effects on this mutation here.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span>Stinger</span></span></span> provides a small boost to Arachnid rep, but this is not enough to become neutral by default so isn't worth much. Arachnid rep in general isn't that useful anyways. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span>Stinger</span></span></span> increases its <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv"><span class="nowrap">PV</span></span></span> with rank, and stays fairly relevant with investment. Your <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength"><span class="nowrap">Strength</span></span></span> also does not factor into this <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv"><span class="nowrap">PV</span></span></span> whatsoever, so it's always at the same efficacy. The damage it deals is unfortunately low, especially for being a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Long Blade.png" /></span>Long</span> Blade</span></span> class weapon. Rank 10 only puts it on par with a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Dagger6.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="K"><span class="injected"><span class="y">c</span><span class="y">r</span><span class="K">y</span><span class="g">s</span><span class="g">t</span><span class="K">e</span><span class="y">e</span><span class="y">l</span></span></span> dagger</span></span></span></span>, which means it's not doing that much damage. However, the damage value it does is actually completely irrelevant because no matter what, the <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span>Stinger</span></span></span> can only penetrate **once**. That's right, even against an enemy with 0 <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span>Stinger</span></span></span> will only penetrate a single time. This makes it pretty useless as anything aside from a venom delivery tool, especially because the <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span>Sting</span></span></span> attack automatically hits, penetrates and inflicts the venom. The <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span>Stinger</span></span></span> will always strike on a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span>Charge</span></span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Lunge.png" /></span>Lunge</span></span></span>, but relies on <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span>Sting</span></span></span> being off cooldown to apply venom.

Each venom has a <span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness"><span class="nowrap">Toughness</span></span></span> save to resist it, so in order for the venom to stay relevant, the <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span>Stinger</span></span></span> must receive investment. Robots are immune to all <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span>Stinger</span></span></span> venom, so these mutations are useless against them. By rank 7, the venom should always work except on creatures with the highest <span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness"><span class="nowrap">Toughness</span></span></span> values in the game. Also notable is that when <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span>Stingers</span></span></span> strike, their strikes will be doubled by <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Expertise.png" /></span>Weapon</span> Expertise</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Mastery.png" /></span>Weapon</span> Mastery</span></span>, so these skills can vastly improve the amount of venom injected.

Confused as an effect will essentially negate the enemy it hits for the duration. If this enemy is the only one around or is locked in a corridor, then the fight against it is pretty much guaranteed. It can also be used to remove an enemy to temporarily deal with another. The problem is the confused enemy will wander around and make room for another enemy, so you need to be careful not to introduce a more dangerous threat that you would have rather saved your <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandSting.png" /></span>Sting</span></span></span> for. It will also reduce the targets <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap">MA</span></span></span>, which probably isn't super handy unless you are playing a melee <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> build with psionic weapons and psychic attacks. It can be useful in the right circumstances, but is definitely overshadowed by the other venom.

### Stinger (Paralyzing Venom)

</div>

This mutation just gives you a few free turns on non-robots. With investment, you can reach 4-7 rounds of paralysis, which is less than what you get from confusing venom with the added benefit of keeping the enemy still, easy to hit and not replaced by more dangerous stuff. At rank 10 and very high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower"><span class="nowrap">Willpower</span></span></span>, you can nearly permanently paralyze enemies with this venom; an ability that becomes more effective with rapid advancement. While this can be good, it's useless on robots and requires a very particular build that invests in <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower"><span class="nowrap">Willpower</span></span></span>.

### Stinger (Poisoning Venom)

The venom here can deal pretty significant damage; the only downside is that it's over time. Another downside is most enemies with the <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span> to tank the damage over time before you kill them are high level robots, which are immune to the poison. It also reduces their healing, but that's pretty irrelevant since enemies don't tend to heal unless it's something like an <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Arconaut.png" /></span>arconaut</span></span></span> that happens to have a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SalveTonic.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="Y">salve</span></span></span> injector</span></span>. Can also be used with hit-and-run tactics, where it tends to shine the most as long as you have the space to work (<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Teleport Other.png" /></span>Teleport</span> Other</span></span> comes to mind here, give them a sting and love tap to the other side of the map).

To be sure, this mutation can be quite strong if you're able to clear the distance or disable your opponent (<span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Cudgel.png" /></span>Cudgel</span></span></span> stuns, freezing, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span>Phasing</span></span></span>). For 4 mutation points, it ends up being quite expensive for a damage option that just doesn't always work (robots immune) and incentivises a (in my opinion) very boring playstyle. I see this more as a more specific <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span>Corrosive</span> Gas Generation</span></span> with no defensive utility that costs more, but if you're willing to play and build around it this can reliably kill enemies. Something important to mention is the damage of the poison stacks with itself, so multiple strikes with <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Expertise.png" /></span>Weapon</span> Expertise</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Weapon Mastery.png" /></span>Weapon</span> Mastery</span></span> go _extra_ hard with this one.

One of the better 1 MP mutations, this will make you neutral to <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Baboon.png" /></span>baboons</span></span></span> and give some bonus ape reputation which can be handy for finding <span class="spoiler spoiler-background" title="Spoiler: Hidden endgame creature" onclick="this.classList.toggle('spoiler');"><span class="spoiler-text">Spoiler: Hidden endgame creature</span><span class="spoiler-content"><span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Oboroqoru.png" /></span>Oboroqoru's</span></span></span> lair or even water ritualing the man himself,</span></span> and the 5% bump to cold and heat resistance is nice. If you got leftover points, this is a pretty good one to take.

Like with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Double-muscled.png" /></span>Double-muscled</span></span></span>, this mutation is strong in very similar ways. Instead of damage, we get accuracy and become harder to hit, which makes this very handy since you can never "cap" on <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility"><span class="nowrap">Agility</span></span></span> returns. While you don't get a particularly _reliable_ chance to not use your cooldown of an <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility"><span class="nowrap">Agility</span></span></span>-based ability, you get a _decent_ chance especially at rank 10. If you're relying on it to save you, you'll probably be out of luck when you really need it, so this mutation is more of a "win more" mutation that benefits being proactive and really using as many <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility"><span class="nowrap">Agility</span></span></span>-based abilities as possible.

With this mutation boosting <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility"><span class="nowrap">Agility</span></span></span>, you can also ignore investment into this attribute in favor of boosting your other attributes as long as you invest the mutation points into the mutation.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Regeneration.png" /></span>Regeneration</span></span></span> doesn't protect you from all status effects; in fact some of the most crippling and hardest to avoid status effects are not covered by <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Regeneration.png" /></span>Regeneration</span></span></span>. Daze, stun and confused all are covered by the effects this mutation can shake off at a massive 50% rate _per turn_. This is effectively improved with higher quickness as you have more turns to proc the chance before the enemy gets to take their turns. Additionally, after the Moon Stair update a lot of creatures got access to skills like <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Menacing Stare.png" /></span>Menacing</span> Stare</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Berate.png" /></span>Berate</span></span></span>, giving this mutation even more efficacy as it can shake off shamed and terrified.

<span class="spoiler spoiler-background" title="Spoiler: Hidden endgame creature and its mechanics" onclick="this.classList.toggle('spoiler');"><span class="spoiler-text">Spoiler: Hidden endgame creature and its mechanics</span><span class="spoiler-content">For those of you looking to tackle the games greatest challenges, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Two-headed.png" /></span>Two-headed</span></span></span> is a considerable boon against the Nephilim <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qon.png" /></span>Qon</span></span></span>. She constantly confuses the player during the fight, and being able to resist this with reasonable effectiveness is huge, especially to those uncomfortable with fighting while confused. With the addition of many creatures that are able to use these debilitating effects that <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Two-headed.png" /></span>Two-headed</span></span></span> can negate, it has really brought up its usefulness. The best part of all this? This is at rank 1 and needs no further investment!</span></span>

You also gain a second head, and with that comes a headgear slot and a face slot. There are many fantastic face slot items and with two heads, you don't have to worry about relying on the two-faced mod to enjoy multiple. In fact, you can still use two-faced and get even more face slot items. Headgear also comes with the benefit of the fitted with filters mod, so at high gear tiers you can become basically immune to gas by stacking fitted with filters modded items. Stacking <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> with severed faces is also a common strategy at higher tiers of play with this mutation.

For a <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Chimera.png" /></span>Chimera</span></span></span> or primarily physical mutation focused build, this is where the benefits end. If you're running a build heavy on mental mutations, you get the actual ranked benefit of this mutation which is the mental action cost reduction. This is basically a quickness buff for your mental mutations which can be handy for spamming a rotation of mental abilities (like a <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Syphon Vim.png" /></span>Syphon</span> Vim</span></span> into <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Teleportation.png" /></span>Teleportation</span></span></span> without retaliation) or for specifically <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Light Manipulation.png" /></span>Light</span> Manipulation</span></span> to shred something apart in the blink of an eye. Additionally, it gives those mental focused builds a physical mutation to sink rapid advancements into so they aren't wasted.

There is a downside to this mutation, and that is that your equipment's <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/dodgeValue.png" /></span>DV</span></span></span> bonuses will be averaged across all the extra slots you now have meaning you have to get more equipment. Luckily, headgear is easy enough to come by that shouldn't be an issue, but in the midgame you may struggle with fleshing out your face slots. Oh, and I guess this also lets you take a <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Decapitate.png" /></span>Decapitate</span></span></span> on the chin, so there's that too.

<span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness"><span class="nowrap">Toughness</span></span></span> is good, don't get me wrong, but the added ability to <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span>Sprint</span></span></span> longer?

Because the secondary effect isn't one that's really useful, and the fact that I typically don't want for <span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness"><span class="nowrap">Toughness</span></span></span> even without this mutation leaves me rating it lower than the other attribute boosting mutations. Similar to <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Regeneration.png" /></span>Regeneration</span></span></span>, this mutation becomes less useful the more you know about the game.

Last physical mutation and boy do we end on a banger.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Wings.png" /></span>Wings</span></span></span> can either be unbelievable or practically useless depending on how you play the game. If you like to go on long excursions underground and practically never see the daylight, you won't get as much out of this mutation. But make no mistake, this is one of the very best there is.

This mutation requires investment, but not much: at minimum, bring this mutation to rank 6. At rank 6, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Wings.png" /></span>Wings</span></span></span> offers perfect <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandFlyToggle.png" /></span>Flight</span></span></span>, meaning that you will **never** fall unless you melee attack while flying. This means you are immune to all melee attacks while on the surface **and** you can always flee to the world map. Taking <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandFlyToggle.png" /></span>Flight</span></span></span> and landing do not take turns either, so you can perfectly control when you are in the air or on the ground with no cost.

You also move incredibly fast while <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span>Sprinting</span></span></span> with this mutation as well, making closing or growing the gap with <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/CommandToggleRunning.png" /></span>Sprint</span></span></span> extremely effective. Speaking of growing or closing the gap, it will also significantly enhance your <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Charge.png" /></span>Charge</span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Jump.png" /></span>Jump</span></span></span> range, meaning your melee builds have insane movement potential. In case this wasn't enough, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Wings.png" /></span>Wings</span></span></span> also provides fantastic utility with overworld travel, as you move way faster and hardly ever get lost.

In case these benefits are not enough, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Wings.png" /></span>Wings</span></span></span> also make several quests in the game a near surefire win. Like <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Multiple Legs.png" /></span>Multiple</span> Legs</span></span>, I was not a big believer in <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Wings.png" /></span>Wings</span></span></span> until I took them for several runs.

</div>

As an ability, gaining a follower is really good. Followers are quite powerful, and by having good <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> or investment into <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Beguiling.png" /></span>Beguiling</span></span></span> you can get followers that are a bit higher level than you. You can also use this mutation to convert a dangerous enemy to your side so you don't have to fight it. Only problem with this is if you're actually facing an enemy that can dunk on you alone, you're probably not able to <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/CommandBeguileCreature.png" /></span>Beguile</span></span></span> it reliably or even at all so you're probably not using it for that.

While followers are good, legendary creatures are head and shoulders _far_ above normal creatures and you're only able to have a single follower via <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Beguiling.png" /></span>Beguiling</span></span></span>. The thing about legendary creatures is that they can **all** be recruited via water ritual. Of course, you do save a lot of reputation by using this mutation instead of converting via water ritual; but you _unfortunately_ anger anyone who resists your <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Beguiling.png" /></span>Beguiling</span></span></span>.

So, we've got a lot of problems here. We can only gain 1 follower, and if we mess up that potential follower is now angry with us, so we're not even really comfortable using it on neutral creatures unless we're sure we won't fail. Then what happens when your follower dies? You've just lost a considerable amount of power. You can of course gain it back with another, but if that follower was only powerful because of levels you are in a tricky scenario.

There's also a skill that does essentially the exact same thing as <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Beguiling.png" /></span>Beguiling</span></span></span> (just without any bonus <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span>), but it's actually _more_ reliable since you don't anger enemies you fail to convert with <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Proselytize.png" /></span>Proselytize</span></span></span>. With <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Proselytize.png" /></span>Proselytize</span></span></span>, you can also convert creatures with a mental shield like oozes and if there is any chance of converting a neutral creature, you can take all the tries you need to succeed. All that for a couple skill points, for free if we start as an Acolyte or for 300 rep from the faction that has the easiest method of gaining reputation; the Mechanimists.

To really seal the deal here, it costs 5 mutation points to start with this one. Are followers good? Yes. Is the extra <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span> significant? Not really. All in all, this mutation's rank is carried by the incredible potential followers have, but you'll probably want to end up avoiding this one.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burgeoning.png" /></span>Burgeoning</span></span></span> is somewhat hard to rank, because the reasons why it is effective are the exact same reasons why it is extremely deadly to yourself. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burgeoning.png" /></span>Burgeoning</span></span></span> lives and dies by RNG. Early ranks of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burgeoning.png" /></span>Burgeoning</span></span></span> spawn pretty worthless plants; <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Qudzu.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="r">qudzu</span></span></span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Seed-Spitting Vine.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="g">seed-spitting</span> vines</span></span></span></span> and the like. Mid to late ranks of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burgeoning.png" /></span>Burgeoning</span></span></span> spawn very deadly plants, which (especially when placed directly on enemies) can be used to great effectiveness. The problem here are 2 plants in particular: <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Feral Lah.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="r">feral</span> lah</span></span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Aloe Pyra.png" /></span>aloe</span> pyra</span></span>.

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Feral Lah.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="r">Feral</span> lah</span></span></span></span> is the plant that creates <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Feral Lah Pod.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="r">tumbling</span> pods</span></span></span></span>, the explosive seeds that blow up from damage or proximity. While they won't blow up from _your_ proximity since they're allied with us, they will blow up from the proximity of anything hostile to you. Hostile things tend to move directly to you, so there's a good chance that the enemy creature is somewhat close to you. Worse still is that a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Feral Lah Pod.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="r">tumbling</span> pod</span></span></span></span> can cause a chain reaction and the pods tend to stack together near the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Feral Lah.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="r">feral</span> lah</span></span></span></span> once it doesn't detect any more enemies around. Then when a new one gets into range, they start to move over and all blow up. If you're remotely close to the explosion, that puts you in it too. These also tend to blow up the rest of your plants as well.

<span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Aloe Pyra.png" /></span>Aloe</span> pyra</span></span> don't move; instead they sit there and don't do much. When they're stepped on, they will spew a burst of flame in all 4 cardinal directions across the map. Since other plants from your <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burgeoning.png" /></span>Burgeoning</span></span></span> can trigger this fire explosion, you can be immolated quickly and easily by your own <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burgeoning.png" /></span>Burgeoning</span></span></span>; especially if multiple <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Aloe Pyra.png" /></span>aloe</span> pyra</span></span> spawn from the same <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burgeoning.png" /></span>Burgeoning</span></span></span>. The map can easily devolve into a chaotic mess of flame and agony from liberal use of this mutation, and the world burns even hotter when you combine this with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Temporal Fugue.png" /></span>Temporal</span> Fugue</span></span> (god save you).

If you don't care about the world incinerating or you have 100% heat resistance, this is actually quite a powerful mutation due to its very low cooldown and powerful plants especially at the high tiers (looking for rank 13 <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burgeoning.png" /></span>Burgeoning</span></span></span>). However, before that it will likely get you killed more often than not.

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Clairvoyance.png" /></span>Clairvoyance</span></span></span> is a mutation that **really** needs investment; and it needs quite a bit for it to be meaningfully useful. But when it is useful, it's _really_ useful. Early on, the radius is poor, the duration is short and the cooldown is very long. It's only through strong investment that these 3 become manageable, but any form of vision through walls is very powerful. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Clairvoyance.png" /></span>Clairvoyance</span></span></span> will show basically everything in the radius (even <span class="spoiler spoiler-background" title="Spoiler: Mid game boss" onclick="this.classList.toggle('spoiler');"><span class="spoiler-text">Spoiler: Mid game boss</span><span class="spoiler-content"><span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Troll King 3.png" /></span>Haggabah</span></span></span></span></span>) and since it grants you sight of that area, it synergizes very well with other mutations that require vision (like <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span>Sunder</span> Mind</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Burgeoning.png" /></span>Burgeoning</span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Cryokinesis.png" /></span>Cryokinesis</span></span></span>, etc). It's cheap to get and just gets better with time; just don't be expecting much at the start.

### Confusion

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Confusion.png" /></span>Confusion</span></span></span> is in a really unique space as a mutation. It's got a pretty long cooldown and the duration of the effect isn't super impressive and the range on it isn't crazy either. However, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Confusion.png" /></span>Confusion</span></span></span> synergizes with nearly _every_ mental mutation by lowering the target's mental armor significantly. It also pacifies the enemy for the duration, meaning you can just as easily use it to turn the tides in your favor. Since it's AOE, you can use it to weaken enemies for you to either focus a single / few enemies or to get away and escape or position yourself more effectively. You do need to be careful about using this on <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span>Espers</span></span></span> as they could potentially have <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Mental Mirror.png" /></span>Mental</span> Mirror</span></span>, in which case this is disastrous. But as long as you're careful with this in that specific scenario, you can supercharge your other mutations by weakening enemies with this one.

At low ranks, enemies are just going to walk out of it. At high ranks, you'll get the enemies in the initial range since it'll freeze them, but it won't do much damage. If you get too close to the area at high ranks, you'll end up frozen as well if you linger for too long. This mutation needs quite a bit of investment to be capable of even freezing an enemy caught in the initial zone. Enemies will just walk around this or wait out the 3 turns it's active, so you'll only ever hit creatures you specifically drop this on. And 4 MP to start with this trash? Give this mutation a miss.

### Disintegration

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Disintegration.png" /></span>Disintegration</span></span></span> can do some pretty respectable damage early if you pour investment into it, but the problem here is that it doesn't scale nearly fast enough to keep up with one-shotting enemies. You can use <span class="injected"><span class="g">b</span><span class="G">i</span><span class="W">o</span><span class="M">s</span><span class="W">c</span><span class="G">a</span><span class="g">n</span><span class="g">n</span><span class="g">i</span><span class="g">n</span><span class="g">g</span></span> to help you identify when an enemy is weak enough for a <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Disintegration.png" /></span>Disintegration</span></span></span> since it does do a hefty amount of damage, but the exhaustion really really hurts. It means that failing to kill all things around you with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Disintegration.png" /></span>Disintegration</span></span></span> leaves you incredibly vulnerable. Since it deals unbelievable amounts of damage to structures, you're almost guaranteed to be very exposed after using it.

The problem with this mutation is that resonance grenades to basically the same thing except they can be thrown and don't exhaust you. So not only can you use these grenades at range, but you can also use them over and over again until they get close. It can be used as a last-resort, but there are other mutations that are on the defensive side that work far more often and in far more scenarios.

### Domination

**Character Creation Rating:** <span class="star-filled">★ ★ ★ ★ ★ </span><span class="star-empty"></span>

**Mutation Buy Rating:** <span class="star-filled">★ ★ ★ ★ ★ </span><span class="star-empty"></span>

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span>Domination</span></span></span> is in the running for most powerful mutation in the game, and it makes a very compelling argument for it. Just with this single mutation, you can turn literally any character into an absolute monster. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span>Domination</span></span></span> needs no assistance and no builds, only the know-how of how to abuse it.

We can begin at the basic level of understanding for <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span>Domination</span></span></span>. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span>Domination</span></span></span> lasts a considerable amount of time (200 rounds at rank 1), and it's clear that this was its intended function. We can take control over a creature, and if we are the same level or at least close, we're nearly guaranteed to succeed in this. We can draw a particularly strong enemy out to safety, then take control of it and proceed to fight other enemies until that creature dies. If the creature lives too long, we can steer it into dangerous liquids or remove any weapons / armor that it might have to weaken it. If we really want to take it a step further, we can even have the creature target itself and kill itself while dominated. While using <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span>Domination</span></span></span> in this way, it's advised to have a powerful defensive mutation like <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span>Phasing</span></span></span> in order to protect yourself if an enemy makes it to you while in the other creature's body, as after taking damage your <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span>Domination</span></span></span> breaks and you come back to your own body.

The second level of understanding is that we can get ourselves a follower that we are capable of dominating. This works particularly well if this follower is particularly capable in combat in a way you are not. You can control this follower's body to investigate a dungeon floor in safety to yourself. As long as you keep track of your remaining turns in <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span>Domination</span></span></span>, you can reel the follower back in just before the dominate ends, refresh your cooldown and do it all over again. Actually, if you stand outside of the zone the follower is fighting in, you don't even need to do that last part because when the <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span>Domination</span></span></span> breaks, it will instantly be teleported to you. You gain the body of a strong creature and keep yourself in perfect safety. If the follower dies, well better them than us as we can find another and rebuild.

The third level of understanding comes naturally after the second. Followers level up and gain skill points, attribute points, and (if they're not a robot or a templar) mutation points. However, they're not smart enough in the base game to _use_ those resources and there's no way we can direct them to. However, while we dominate a creature, we take **full control** over their body as if it were our own, allowing us to spend their resources in any way we wish. With this, we can have multiple followers that are all just as powerful as us, if not far more powerful. With the boosted stats of legendary creatures, this combination can make an absolutely frightening monster under your full control. You can also ensure that your follower has exactly what you want equipped and not just whatever autoequip has decided to put on them (it tends to favor <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/armorValue.png" /></span>AV</span></span></span> in most scenarios). We can then leave them to wander and protect us (the AI will use mobility skills with ruthless efficiency) or take their bodies for our own to scout ahead or clear out floors under our control.

The fourth level of understanding also follows from the second, and that is if we are able to gain full control over our followers and enemies, we can also do this to merchants and allies with equipment that we want. Instead of having to kill these creatures, which we may not want to do as not to draw their hostility or because we want them to restock, we can simply dominate them and take their belongings. A successful dominate will not cause a creature to be hostile, but a failed one will. We can work around this by simply ensuring the creature we are dominating is weaker than us to the point our dominate is guaranteed to succeed or to be a little more careful and use <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span>Precognition</span></span></span> as well. Using this, we can get uber powerful followers, infinite money and all the items we could ever want.

The fifth and final level of understanding cuts out the middleman in level 3: instead of powering up a more powerful body, why not permanently take it for your own? That's right, any creature you can dominate can be permanently under your control if you can obliterate your own body in a single hit. This is easier than it sounds, because you can just target and punch yourself down to low <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap"><span class="stat-container"><img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Text/hitpoints.png" /></span>HP</span></span></span>, then equip some high-damage rifle in the body you want while dominating it and take the final shot on your old body. Doing so will permanently place your mind in that body, but will not transfer over any of your stats, skills or mutations. Therefore, this tends to be better to do when swapping to powerful bodies that are at level 1, such as village mayors, <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Baboon.png" /></span>baboons</span></span></span>, and merchants.

There are many reasons to use <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span>Domination</span></span></span>, and not only are they all incredibly good, but they also all have virtually no downsides and only extreme upsides. It's a high cost to start with this mutation, but it is absolutely worth it.

Since you likely won't be fighting in melee often, if you find yourself in a situation where you want to fight in melee you can use this mutation to give you the stats necessary to succeed. It's got a fairly steep cost, but doesn't require too much investment since if you're picking this up, you should have a fairly high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> in the first place. If you _don't_ have a high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span>, then this is not the mutation for you. If you're taking this at all, it's because your build works well with it. Otherwise, not a great mutation.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span> surrounds you in a nigh-impenetrable barrier that moves as you move. There's not much more that needs to be said for you to know this is a banger of a mutation. You can shoot through it, fire ranged mutations through it, whatever. You can even synergize it with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Disintegration.png" /></span>Disintegration</span></span></span> to nullify the exhaustion period. Since it means enemies are totally incapable of pathfinding to you, if there's not another enemy in vision they'll just stand there for you to kill them (most of the time). If you've found yourself in a bad spot, you can pop <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span> and use a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Blank Recoiler.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="Y">recoiler</span></span></span></span></span> to get out. If you can kill an enemy before the duration of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span> is down, you've won; they have no possible chance to beat you.

The bubble won't push out gasses, which can be a good and a bad thing. If you yourself can produce gasses, then wonderful; you can sit in safety while your gas cloud gains density, then move back to draw in creatures (or push them with the <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span> into the cloud). However, there are a number of extremely deadly gasses that the bubble will not save you against, so be careful you don't walk into a dense cloud of death.

There are some creatures that will still determine that they can make an attempt at breaking through your <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span>; creatures like <span class="spoiler spoiler-background" title="Spoiler: Secret boss creature" onclick="this.classList.toggle('spoiler');"><span class="spoiler-text">Spoiler: Secret boss creature</span><span class="spoiler-content"><span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Skybear.png" /></span>Saad</span> Amus</span></span> with his <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Ceremonial Khopesh.png" /></span>ceremonial</span> vibrokhopesh</span></span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Chrome Pyramid.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="c">chrome</span> pyramids</span></span></span></span> with their <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Swarm Rack.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="m">swarm</span> rack</span></span></span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Galgal.png" /></span>galgal</span></span></span> with their <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Naser Cannon.png" /></span>naser</span> cannon</span></span> will detect they have a good chance of punching through the forcefield and will attempt it. Be careful with this, as you might _think_ yourself invincible by pumping up this mutation, only to be humbled by a creature that can combat it.

At low ranks, it already lasts a fairly considerable amount of time (12 rounds at rank 1). This means it's one of the rare mental mutations that is VERY good even without any investment or even any <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> at all. At higher ranks, it lasts quite a long time and can eventually get near perpetually or actually perpetually on.

### Force Wall

At first glance, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Wall.png" /></span>Force</span> Wall</span></span> seems to be a very finicky, weaker version of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span>. However, unlike <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span> we choose where to place our 9 tiles of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Wall.png" /></span>Force</span> Wall</span></span> which leads to this mutation being limited more by the imagination than anything else. While inferior in terms of a panic button as the wall will not push away enemies, it is far more powerful in the hands of a proactive player.

While you won't be able to walk with the wall surrounding you, you can combine <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Wall.png" /></span>Force</span> Wall</span></span> with <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Juke.png" /></span>Juke</span></span></span> in order to surround yourself with walls to be able to teleport out or go to the world map, making it nearly as good as <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span> in that aspect. In addition to that basic defensive ability, you can also place it around enemies (as you have likely had done to you at one point or another when angering high-level Mechanimists) to then rain death upon them. Doing so this way has the added benefit of ensuring that enemy stays put whereas with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span> it could turn its attention to something else and continue to move around. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Wall.png" /></span>Force</span> Wall</span></span> also deals with <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/RocketTurret.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="G">rocket</span> turrets</span></span></span></span> far more effectively since you can place the wall right in front of the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/RocketTurret.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="G">rocket</span> turret</span></span></span></span> to destroy it while <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span> can only temporarily withstand the barrage.

Additionally, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Wall.png" /></span>Force</span> Wall</span></span> has a higher duration than <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span>, which can lead to infinite uptime much more easily. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Wall.png" /></span>Force</span> Wall</span></span> is my preferred forcefield generation method and the fact that it costs less than <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span> as well is just another bonus.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Kindle.png" /></span>Kindle's</span></span></span> design is completely baffling to me. It has a 25% chance to heat a target by 100 degrees each turn it shares a tile with it, which is not enough to set them on fire. Chances are that by the time this rolls twice, the target will have cooled already and still won't be set on fire. This effectiveness only decreases as the game goes on and more enemies are resistant to being ignited. It provides a pathetic amount of light and can't be moved. All of these are somewhat understandable for a 1 MP mutation, but then you look at the cooldown… 50 turn cooldown for _this_? Pick something else.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Light Manipulation.png" /></span>Light</span> Manipulation</span></span> is the only somewhat reliable mental mutation in terms of damage; all other mental mutations simply have far too long of a cooldown or don't have reliable killing power. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Light Manipulation.png" /></span>Light</span> Manipulation</span></span> can definitely get the job done, but the more you rely on it the worse off you are when you meet more and more enemies. The damage is good and the fact that it never misses is amazing, but uses come back pretty slowly. If <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Light Manipulation.png" /></span>Light</span> Manipulation</span></span> is your only source of damage, you'll eventually run out of uses or meet an enemy that can withstand your damage.

If you use <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Light Manipulation.png" /></span>Light</span> Manipulation</span></span> as a supporting ranged option, then it does its job quite well. Relying on it for light is a tricky balance since as you use it, you can see less and less so you'll probably still want a light source anyways even if you have a high rank <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Light Manipulation.png" /></span>Light</span> Manipulation</span></span>. It won't scale to the very most powerful enemies in the game, but will get the job done reliably with virtually any normal enemy as long as you keep putting points into it.

Here's a cute little trick you can do with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Light Manipulation.png" /></span>Light</span> Manipulation</span></span> though: get high quickness and a high rank <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Two-headed.png" /></span>Two-headed</span></span></span> to reduce your mental action cost, then stab a creature with a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/SkulkTonic.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="b">s</span><span class="b">k</span><span class="B">u</span><span class="b">l</span><span class="b">k</span></span></span> injector</span></span>. You now do double damage to them and can send off a massive volley of beams. Have fun.

If you use a lot of mental mutations, then this can be handy in case you come across an unexpected powerful enemy after using up your cooldowns. It can also be a fun mutation to spam your other mutations with and laugh maniacally as chaos fills up your screen. However, this comes with a **very** heavy cooldown, meaning that you're only ever doing this once per combat really.

I also do not like this mutation for the negative Seeker of the Sightless way reputation. Seekers are some of the most dangerous enemies in the game because of their psychic weaponry and weapon skills, so making it any harder to become neutral with them is usually just a bad idea; especially because the benefit this mutation gives becomes less useful the better you are at the game as you won't get into situations where it is useful very often. On top of this, using it raises your glimmer so the more you use it, the more dangerous the psychic assassins will become; simply unnecessary added risk. In case this wasn't enough, while it does have the chance to save you if you play poorly, you can play perfectly and through no fault of your own get absolutely screwed and have all your mental mutations put on cooldown. If this happens at the wrong time, this can just lead to your death. Is it fun? Yea it can be fun. Should you use it if you're trying to improve at the game? Probably not.

### Mental Mirror

It is extremely difficult to raise your <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap">MA</span></span></span>, so the fact that <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Mental Mirror.png" /></span>Mental</span> Mirror</span></span> not only gives you quite a considerable amount of <span class="injected"><span class="stat"><span class="nowrap">MA</span></span></span> but also reflects mental attacks back means this is quite good. However, the downside to this is that it will only do so once and then go on cooldown. Luckily for us, most triggers of this have their own, equally long cooldown so chances are it'll be up again by the time we get attacked again (the only exception being psychic weapon attacks).

While this mutation single handedly secures you against virtually any mental attack (as long as you don't dump <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower"><span class="nowrap">Willpower</span></span></span>), there are so few creatures that are actually capable of any of these attacks that we can also pacify the factions (Seekers of the Sightless Way and Svardym) and probably would want to anyways. If you plan on getting a lot of glimmer and partaking in <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Esper.png" /></span>Esper</span></span></span> battles, this is a good mutation to have. Otherwise, we can play around this and then you'll get literally no benefit once you get a few Schrodinger pages.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span>Precognition</span></span></span> is in the running for the best mutation in the game, and like <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span>Domination</span></span></span> also requires absolutely no investment in order to still be incredible. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span>Precognition</span></span></span> has so many uses in fact that I won't be able to cover all of them, but I'll go over the main ones. While <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span>Precognition</span></span></span> won't save you from every kind of death, it will save you from most which is all we can ask for really.

The biggest drawback of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span>Precognition</span></span></span> is that you need to have a little precognition of your own in order to use it most effectively. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span>Precognition</span></span></span> is best when you anticipate a dangerous or otherwise irreversible situation and want to know what will happen before committing to an outcome. Putting ranks into the mutation helps give you extra leeway in choosing this specific moment to reverse to, but the more you learn the game the better your sense of when to start your vision becomes. It's especially handy if you can see a risky move in the middle of combat that could be disastrous if it goes poorly, but combat-defining if successful. If you pop your <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span>Precognition</span></span></span> just before committing to the risky move, you can try your dangerous move and if it doesn't go well, just try a more conservative option or potentially even flee.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span>Precognition</span></span></span> is also a great mutation for learning the game in case you're not interested in roleplay mode. It lets you learn more easily where your mistakes are made or the power of certain enemies without jeopardizing your run.

We can use <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span>Precognition</span></span></span> to see what our mutation buys will be, and there are ways of rerolling those options in case you don't like them. We can practically guarantee desired results from <span class="injected"><span class="y">drops of <span class="injected"><span class="W">n</span><span class="w">e</span><span class="g">c</span><span class="G">t</span><span class="W">a</span><span class="w">r</span></span></span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="g">b</span><span class="g">r</span><span class="g">a</span><span class="w">i</span><span class="W">n</span><span class="W"> </span><span class="W">b</span><span class="w">r</span><span class="g">i</span><span class="g">n</span><span class="g">e</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Gamma Moth.png" /></span>gamma</span> moth</span></span> mutation rolls, albeit with great effort and expending other expensive resources (and typically also with the assistance of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Domination.png" /></span>Domination</span></span></span>). We can even guarantee the stat or mutation point we want from an <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/NectarTonic.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="Y">E</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="M">t</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="Y">r</span><span class="Y">s</span><span class="Y">'</span></span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="W">n</span><span class="w">e</span><span class="g">c</span><span class="G">t</span><span class="W">a</span><span class="w">r</span></span> injector</span></span>.</span></span>

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Precognition.png" /></span>Precognition</span></span></span> is one of those mutations that has endless applications that will continually come up the more you learn about the game.

Here's the deal: <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> is a largely redundant mutation. For the way I prefer to play, there's never any reason for me to take it. However, I would be dishonest if I used this as the only way to rate it. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> has 3 abilities that are all pretty cool, but basically invalidated by an average <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence"><span class="nowrap">Intelligence</span></span></span> score (which you should have in every run anyway).

The first ability is the most unique; having this mutation (even at rank one) acts as a permanent <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Purple Security Card.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="M">military</span> security card</span></span></span></span>. This is cool, but only really useful in Grit Gate. You can also just buy a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Pickaxe.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="c">pickaxe</span></span></span></span></span> from <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Mafeo.png" /></span>Mafeo</span></span></span> for like 5 drams and bypass the doors entirely and grab the loot or have a digging mutation. You can also deactivate machines, but again this is only useful in a single place: the Tomb of the Eaters. A Maintenance Security Card does the same thing here, and by this point in the game is pretty easy to get. You can also just walk around the fans and bypass needing to turn them off. It's convenient, but not really worth a mutation.

The second ability is the capability to unerringly identify artifacts up to a certain "complexity". This "complexity" is different from tier, and refers to how hard the artifact is to understand and not necessarily what <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span>Tinkering</span></span></span> skill is required to make it. Unfortunately for <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span>, if you have the basic <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span>Tinkering</span></span></span> skill (which 3 callings start with and everyone can get for rep from Barathrumites) you're probably just as capable of identifying artifacts as <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> will ever get you to be. If you're dumb as dirt and have no <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence"><span class="nowrap">Intelligence</span></span></span>, then <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> (with considerable investment) _can_ serve as a way to figure out what artifacts are without having to pay a premium to a tinkerer. You'll need rank 8 <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> to identify any artifact without mods.

The third ability is the most useful, and what you will _actually_ use <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> for. You can learn how to make an artifact, but this is more difficult than just identifying so you can only do this to lower tier artifacts. You'll need rank 13 <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> to be able to learn how to make any artifact. The problem with this is that it requires you to have the artifact already, and if you have the artifact you probably don't need to make another. You can use this to make very expensive artifacts like <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/High-Voltage Arc Winder.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="W">high-voltage</span></span></span> arc winders</span></span> for money, but by this point you're probably not hurting for money in the first place. In addition to these requirements, you still need the <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span>Tinkering</span></span></span> skill to make the item and the bits to do so and you **cannot** learn mods. Mods are the primary reason to use <span class="injected"><span class="skill"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Abilities/Tinkering.png" /></span>Tinkering</span></span></span> in general, so not being able to learn them with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> kinda defeats its purpose outside of very specific situations.

Where <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> is quite useful is in learning recipes for injectors or grenades, since these are artifacts that you actually do want quite a number of. However, these artifacts have incredibly low complexity, meaning that you can have rank 1 <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> and be capable of learning the recipe of _any_ injector or grenade <span class="spoiler spoiler-background" title="Spoiler: Rare craftable items" onclick="this.classList.toggle('spoiler');"><span class="spoiler-text">Spoiler: Rare craftable items</span><span class="spoiler-content">(yes, even <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/NectarTonic.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="Y">E</span><span class="Y">a</span><span class="M">t</span><span class="Y">e</span><span class="Y">r</span><span class="Y">s</span><span class="Y">'</span></span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="W">n</span><span class="w">e</span><span class="g">c</span><span class="G">t</span><span class="W">a</span><span class="w">r</span></span> injector</span></span> and the <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/HandENuke.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="m">Hand-E-Nuke</span></span></span></span></span>)</span></span>. This may prompt you to say "Well if we get the best part of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> at rank 1, that means it's good without investment right?" Wrong. Well, technically right, but wrong. We can get rank 1 <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Psychometry.png" /></span>Psychometry</span></span></span> by cooking with sun-dried bananas 100% of the time, and the ovens of Ezra contain such a recipe infinitely. Why buy the mutation when we can get it by eating some 'naners? Save yourself the points.

This is not a mutation I like to use, but I'd be lying to say it's useless. While not exactly predictable, using this mutation as a last-ditch effort to put a considerable distance between you and an enemy can be effective (unless that target is a templar with a powered <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/Ontological Anchor.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="K">ontological</span> anchor</span></span></span></span>). The cooldown gets to be quite low with considerable investment and as long as you can keep distance with heightened movement speed or quickness, you can get rid of very powerful enemies by banishing them to a random tile of Qud.

Unfortunately, before this point the cooldown is so huge that you've only got one shot and if you miss (which happens often since the vortex is placed in a random tile next to where you select), then you're just down 1 turn and in no better position than before. Additionally, if you accidentally fall in you could just get placed into certain death, but if the place you were before was already certain death then you may get transported somewhere better which can be a unique if less reliable way of escape (if you're getting this mutation for this, just get <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Wall.png" /></span>Force</span> Wall</span></span>; much more reliable).

Now if you're really lucky, you may get a powerful ally to pop through the vortex if you miss the enemy. What's more likely is that a <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Chrome Pyramid.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="c">chrome</span> pyramid</span></span></span></span> or <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Creatures/Leering Stalker.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="r">leering</span> stalker</span></span></span></span> will play peekaboo and annihilate everything in a 20 tile radius. If you're luckier still, you may get powerful gear in perfect safety. Or, once again you could get a hostile mighty cherubim.

Since this is a somewhat effective way of one-shotting nearly any creature in the late game, I can't rate it 1 star. Until rank 11 however, know that this is firmly a 1 star mutation.

If you're going to use this at all, it requires investment all the way through. The stun only lasts 3 turns and can be saved from or shaken off, so those 3 turns may not be as long as you think. This will push not only enemies, but terrain around as well so it can be extremely annoying when used in corridors. It's got a bad range, pretty hefty cooldown, and fairly low damage. It can be used in clever situations to give yourself a bit of breathing room and is one of the few reliable ways to interrupt <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span>Sunder</span> Mind</span></span>, but don't expect much from this one.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span>Sunder</span> Mind</span></span> is the premier damage mental mutation. Since it has a long cooldown and requires up to 10 turns to complete, you have to really commit to <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span>Sunder</span> Mind</span></span> and can't use it too impulsively. However, if you have 10 turns of space between you and an enemy without a mental shield, that enemy is as good as dead. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span>Sunder</span> Mind</span></span> only requires you to have sight of your enemy, and only requires that you can see it for the first turn since it gives you vision of them until the completion of the attack. While it can be interrupted, it's not likely that this happens often.

If you use <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span>Sunder</span> Mind</span></span> on an enemy, it cannot use <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span>Sunder</span> Mind</span></span> on you which can be a very handy way of preventing yourself from being obliterated by this very mutation. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span>Sunder</span> Mind</span></span> bypasses phase, so you can also use it while <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Phasing.png" /></span>Phasing</span></span></span> to kill from perfect safety. When combined with ways of keeping enemies away from you like <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Corrosive Gas Generation.png" /></span>Corrosive</span> Gas Generation</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sleep Gas Generation.png" /></span>Sleep</span> Gas Generation</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Bubble.png" /></span>Force</span> Bubble</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Force Wall.png" /></span>Force</span> Wall</span></span>, this mutation can single handedly take down even the most powerful of organic enemies from perfect safety.

Using <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span>Sunder</span> Mind</span></span> as a legitimate form of damage requires you to invest fairly heavily into <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span> _or_ the mutation. If you don't, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span>Sunder</span> Mind</span></span> will do practically no damage at all and the turns spent in psychic combat will be better spent hitting the enemy some other way. If you do put investment into this mutation and <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego"><span class="nowrap">Ego</span></span></span>, then you can be practically assured of the death of anything you target.

If you build for <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Syphon Vim.png" /></span>Syphon</span> Vim</span></span>, it can be a pretty good source of damage against targets without a mental shield. On top of that, it can also be a way of healing yourself fairly quickly and synergizes extremely well with defensive mutations like <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Carapace.png" /></span>Carapace</span></span></span>, the gasses and forcefields. If you don't build around this, you're probably never getting it to a point where it's particularly useful since this mutation needs quite a bit of investment in order to be useful. Since it heals you as well as damages the enemy, it can be very useful in cases where you need to simply out-DPS your target since you can sustain through their damage with this and a salve.

Once you use this though it goes on a cripplingly long cooldown, meaning you're only using this once in a combat. Because of this, <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Syphon Vim.png" /></span>Syphon</span> Vim</span></span> is pretty handicapped and not nearly as useful as it could be.

If you're planning on building an army that you micromanage, then maybe this mutation will be a bit helpful for you. For the vast majority of you, you will entirely forget that you have this mutation unless you get <span class="injected"><span class="K">g</span><span class="K">l</span><span class="r">o</span><span class="R">t</span><span class="r">r</span><span class="K">o</span><span class="K">t</span></span> and then you'll be confused why your prices are unaffected.

You do have to be in melee for it to work, but that's probably where the dangerous enemy is anyways. Like <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Spacetime Vortex.png" /></span>Spacetime</span> Vortex</span></span>, without investment you've only got one shot with this but unless the enemy has <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Mental Mirror.png" /></span>Mental</span> Mirror</span></span> you'll always succeed. The downside is that while you are guaranteed to teleport the enemy, there's no guarantee that where they end up is better than where they currently are. In the vast majority of situations, it will work to your benefit. However, there's always a chance they just get sent to your escape route and you remain in largely the same situation as you're currently in.

At high levels, this becomes a non-issue and you can reliably get away from any enemy in the game unless that enemy has <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Teleportation.png" /></span>Teleportation</span></span></span>.

This puts high rank <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Teleportation.png" /></span>Teleportation</span></span></span> as an even more reliable defensive tool than even the forcefields as <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Teleportation.png" /></span>Teleportation</span></span></span> will get you out of being engulfed, cornered or followed with <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Teleportation.png" /></span>Teleportation</span></span></span> from the enemy.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Temporal Fugue.png" /></span>Temporal</span> Fugue</span></span> is an interesting mutation, since as unbelievably powerful it is, you have to be very careful of your inventory to make the most of it. Your fugue clones will have the same inventory as you, and they will use any and all injectors and grenades (and boy does the AI love grenades). The fugue clones also have an incredible love of ranged weapons, so if you own one or have one equipped, you can be all but guaranteed they will spam it at anything and everything.

In addition to your inventory, you also need to be very careful about the mutations that you have since your fugue clones love to spam those as well. In fact, if you slap <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Temporal Fugue.png" /></span>Temporal</span> Fugue</span></span> on otherwise very strong builds with no consideration with how the multiple AI clones will use that build, you can actually hinder yourself or even straight up endanger yourself. Of particular note is when the fugue clones overdose on <span class="injected"><span class="object"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Items/ShadeOilTonic.png" /></span><span class="injected"><span class="y">s</span><span class="K">h</span><span class="c">a</span><span class="b">d</span><span class="B">e</span><span class="y"></span> </span><span class="C">o</span><span class="y">i</span><span class="K">l</span></span> injectors</span></span> and spawn anti-clones of yourself which then proceed to kill you.

Despite all these drawbacks and dangers, having even just 2-3 of yourself pop up at the drop of a hat is so unbelievably powerful that it's worth building entirely around this. <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Temporal Fugue.png" /></span>Temporal</span> Fugue</span></span> works best with builds that focus on one thing and only do that one thing, especially melee-focused builds.

<span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Time Dilation.png" /></span>Time</span> Dilation</span></span> requires you to have a melee build to really use at all. The slowdown falls off so fast outside of melee range that it's not very noticeable at all. Within melee range, it can be used to greatly enhance your 1-on-1 for the 15 turn duration, but unless you're already deadly in melee range you won't get as much out of this. That is to say, unless you're already destroying things in melee, this mutation is not going to suddenly make you competent at it. However, this mutation can give you the edge you need to reliably take out strong enemies in melee.

The fact that the duration cannot be improved really hurts this mutation, but you can severely cripple an enemy's quickness at higher mutation ranks. Against particularly powerful enemies with large health pools, this still may not be enough to kill them and then you still need to survive their onslaught. While a good mutation for sure, it's not the silver bullet that the likes of <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Temporal Fugue.png" /></span>Temporal</span> Fugue</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="mutation"><span class="nowrap"><span class="icon-container">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="inline-icon" src="/icons/Mutations/Sunder Mind.png" /></span>Sunder</span> Mind</span></span> are in their niche.
