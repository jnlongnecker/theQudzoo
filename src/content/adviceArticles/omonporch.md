# The Earl of Omonporch

---

We've decoded the strange signal, but the Barathrumites have more work for us. We are to go to Omonporch and negotiate with its Earl for the next stages of whatever Barathrum has planned. Live and drink, journeyfriend.

## My Name is Earl

Go to Omonporch, have 4 factions favor you, and lower the rep for a few of them. This quest is free. The trip should not be dangerous; the most dangerous thing you will find on your way there are madpoles and that's only if you spend extended time in the rivers. However, you should instead spend your time during this quest preparing for the next one.

We can technically kill the Earl if we so choose, and while xe is not particularly threatening, the attack will anger the Asphodelites nearby which can definitely kill you quickly with electricity. Ideally, we simply take a small reputation penalty to those factions that like us the most. You should easily have representatives from Joppa, the Barathrumites and the Mechanimists by this point, so the final faction shouldn't be too hard to gain if you don't already have it. Factions like the Wardens or Unshelled Reptiles/Birds are good final candidates if nothing is particularly close.

The chaos spiel, while funny, isn't particularly great to actually do. We'll become forced to kill Asphodel while upsetting one representative and gaining reputation with another randomly. If you have the Heirlooms of Qud book, you can discover what heirlooms each faction will give if you spare them of responsibility. I've never been particularly wowed by these heirlooms, but there are some good options if you get lucky and you feel like rolling the dice. Typically, I just share the burden between all or two.
