# New Player Guide

---

If you're brand new to the game, it can be really overwhelming to start. This series of articles is directed at people who have just picked up Caves of Qud and want to know the basics of how things work before they can start making sense of the more advanced articles. Before you start reading these articles, my recommendation is you start a game in Classic mode and return here once you die. This information will settle in far more readily if you have a point of reference. Don't worry about trying to win on your first go or about trying to understand it all. Simply give yourself a foundation for the knowledge of these articles to start to build off of.
