# Map Breakdown

---

The world map can be a bit overwhelming at times, and it can be confusing to know what you'll encounter, what you should look for and when to access certain environments. I'll be talking about the generic tiles first, then the unique tiles.

## Salt Marsh

![Salt marsh]($assetsDir/images/fundamentals/marsh.png)

**Recommended Level**: 1

The salt marsh is the environment most runs begin in. There is little to worry about here being the starting zone; it's here to allow you to get your footing and some starter equipment to set off into the world. Qud has never been so docile.

In a center zone, you can find an oddly-hued glowpad who is a Consortium of Phyta merchant and water ritual-able creature. In a different center zone, you can also find the remains of Argyve's last apprentice which holds a pair of mechanical wings.

In this environment (and indeed in any zone in any environment), you might find fork-horned gnu. This means that there will be chitinous puma also on the map, so be careful and consider avoiding that zone.

Pay close attention to lairs: you can find glowpad and glowfish lairs which give easy Fish and Flowers reputation. Additionally, you can find snapjaw lairs which often have multiple legendary snapjaw in them and some artifacts. Don't forget to get the guaranteed historic site lore from the statue 1 zone north of Joppa!

## Desert Canyon

**Recommended Level**: 5

Aside from containing the first historic site, desert canyons don't have a lot going for them. They're a passerby environment; outside of fetch quests you'll probably never seriously spend time here. They aren't dangerous, don't hold good or common lairs, but aren't toothless enough to level up in early.

While most creatures in the desert canyons are of little threat, the most dangerous is probably the salthopper. It has the capability to Sprint, so the best way to avoid it is to let it Sprint up to you and hit you. This will disable its Sprint, allowing you to activate yours and get away.

The snapjaw that currently holds Stopsvalinn _does_ exist in a random zone in the desert canyons, but it has become much more difficult to find than in the past so it's not as worth it to seek out anymore. If you get lucky then great, but don't spend too much time on it.

## Salt Dunes

![Salt dunes]($assetsDir/images/fundamentals/dunes.png)

**Recommended Level**: 5

Salt dunes have quite a bit going for them. First off, it's more efficient (both turn-wise and water-wise) to travel zone-by-zone instead of on the world map over salt dunes. While you're there, you can find the occasional dromad caravan, Mechanimist grouping, Pariah grouping, Seeker of the Sightless Way grouping or Putus Templar grouping; all valuable in their own ways.

The one major threat of the region are the dawngliders; they fly and have a strong Flaming Ray to hit you with. It's generally recommended to only travel in the daytime in order to see the dawngliders from across the screen and avoid any zones with them in it if you're weak. Additionally, if you're weak you should also consider only traveling zone-by-zone so you don't get lost and land in the middle of a bunch of dawngliders.

It's common to journey in here for some early EXP as long as you know how to avoid the dawngliders as well as obtain an early Issachar Rifle from the Issachari Tribe members that dot the landscape. Just make sure to not get swallowed by the occasional salt kraken.

## Hills & Mountains

![Hills]($assetsDir/images/fundamentals/hills.png)
![Mountains]($assetsDir/images/fundamentals/mountains.png)

**Recommended Level**: 10

Hills & mountains are actually identical in terms of what creatures can appear there, the only difference is you can walk over hills from the world map but not mountains (plus mountains are mostly filled in with walls). Regardless, the only thing worthwhile here are baboon lairs which oftentimes have a huge amount of legendary baboons in them in case you want to hit the reputation roulette.

Generally speaking, you should avoid these tiles. Not just because they are practically worthless, but because they also have a spawn of Seeker Novices that can occur, and do occur somewhat regularly. This makes traveling here somewhat dangerous for even mid-level players if they run into a seeker on the opposite side of the screen while they're near the middle surrounded by a pack of baboons. Be careful in these zones and make sure to have the proper precautions.

## Flower Fields

![Flower fields]($assetsDir/images/fundamentals/flower.png)

**Recommended Level**: 12

Flower fields are one of the most varied overworld environments in all of Qud. They can contain creatures from desert canyons, hills, jungles, and creatures unique to flower fields. Not only that, but they can also rarely spawn in space-time vortices from the surface bringing in creatures from literally anywhere in Qud. This makes flower fields range from toothless to absurdly dangerous depending on your luck.

In the aggregate, flower fields are rather tame. They often will have slugsnouts, an occasional turret and bears as the common threats. In addition to these, you will often find feral lah spewing explosive tumbling pods everywhere, which you will want to take down sooner rather than later.

If you're willing to sift through the nothing, you can occasionally find some good stuff in the flower fields. Probably not worth the risk and the randomness though, best to find other ways.

## Jungles

![Jungles]($assetsDir/images/fundamentals/jungle.png)

**Recommended Level**: 17

The jungle environment is the most common in all of Qud. In fact, it is so common that I strongly recommend getting the Wilderness Lore: Jungles skill to improve your travel through this environment and it's more dangerous variant, deep jungles. The common jungle residents are Naphtaali, goatfolk, and ice frogs; of which the goatfolk are definitely the most prominent threat.

Goatfolk shaman have goatfolk followers, so whenever you see one you can be sure you're in for a bit of a fight. Goatfolk lairs in particular are packed to the gills with these creatures and several legendary shaman, which are definitely your biggest threat here. A legendary goatfolk shaman is a serious threat that should be treated with utmost caution, but the treasures that can be obtained by looting their lairs is often worth the risk. If you do so, make sure you don't leave sower seeds on the ground because they _will_ explode if ignited on the floor.

It's generally not worth it to explore random zones in the jungle. Instead, pop in when you find a goatfolk village as these will have far better loot and keep the population to a predictable goatfolk palette that is usually spread out across the map.

## Ruins

![Ruins]($assetsDir/images/fundamentals/ruins.png)

**Recommended Level**: 20

It's a bit confusing at first, but the term "ruins" is used in-game to refer to several things. There are forgotten/named ruins, which you can find randomly while traveling in any environment and prompted to explore from the world map. For simplicity, we'll refer to these as "forgotten ruins". Forgotten ruins are an entirely different thing from ruins, which is the world map tile environment.

A ruins tile is different from most overworld tiles in that every zone in the parasang has a staircase, and will continue to do so until the 30 strata mark. Within that 30 strata range, the creatures you can encounter are mostly homogenous, with deep jungle tier creatures becoming reasonable to find past strata 20.

You'll primarily find goatfolk near the surface, then past strata 4 you'll encounter mostly robots (particularly turret tinkers). Ruins are fantastic places to visit if you have the capability to disarm turrets as you can make an incredible amount of money by looting guns here. That's not to mention the better-than-average loot that you can find as well, as chests and ground loot are more common here.

There's a healthy mix of creatures that can be found here, but like I mentioned the biggest danger are the robots and especially the turret tinkers. Chaingun turrets, laser rifle turrets and (especially 15 strata+) rocket turrets can be quite commonly encountered here, so if you wish to brave the depths for look be sure to come prepared.

## Rivers

![Rivers]($assetsDir/images/fundamentals/river.png)

**Recommended Level**: 22

There is nothing in the rivers except for blood and anger. It is highly recommended to simply avoid this terrain, and exclusively for 1 single excruciatingly common creature: the madpole. With quite high AV, the madpole is a nuisance more than a threat, but without 18+ AV a madpole is a run-ender to a laissez-faire Qud runner. They latch onto you and dismember you piece by piece, and they are everywhere in the rivers.

If you are favored by Fish, then by all means wander the rivers as now they aren't much of a threat to you. But before that, there's simply nothing here. There are fish lairs (as you might imagine) and flower lairs for glowpads, but it's usually not worth dealing with madpole around every corner. There is a chance that Oboroqoru's lair is in a river tile, in which case just try and avoid the madpole if you're going to explore it.

## Banana Grove

![Banana grove]($assetsDir/images/fundamentals/banana.png)

**Recommended Level**: 25

The banana grove is only found around the Spindle, which makes this a pretty limited environment to explore. However, it is one of if not the most annoying environment to explore zone-by-zone. It is absurdly dense with angry trees all over the place to smack you around and swallow you up. The only reason to come here is to visit the Spindle or a historic site if one can be found here.

It is notable to mention that a somewhat common (if incredibly dull) strategy is to come here fairly early once you have a gun and access to Mafeo for bullets. This is because the only creature that is default hostile to you that can move (the adiyy) is blind, so you can generally avoid it (or just gun it down). This leaves you to spend an eternity shooting the trees in complete safety for easy levels. Do it if you want, just make sure to watch your step.
