# Story Quests

---

I’ll only be covering the quests included in the mainline story; the miscellaneous quests are either literally not dangerous at all, or they don’t really involve a scenario more unique than a normal combat scenario (looking at you, Mamon). For each, I’ll include stats/abilities that you’ll want as well as information about the quest in general. Obviously, spoilers ahead.
