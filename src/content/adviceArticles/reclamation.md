This quest interrupts the We Are Starfreight quest as soon as you arrive at Ezra and needs to be completed in a single shot. If you leave without killing all 4 legendary Templar, the game will tell you that the Templar will regroup. The actual consequences are fairly minor; you just fail the quest and get a new one that's identical to it, including your progress through it. Barathrumites in any zones with an encounter in them are removed, but they don't help much anyway. There also doesn't seem to be a limit at how many "reattempts" you're allowed either, so don't worry too much about it.

## Surveying the Scene

When you arrive at Ezra, you will find that it is under attack by an enormous military force of Templars. There will be 4 legendary Templar that must be killed for the quest to completed, and partway into the attack a Girsh Nephilim will arrive in a random zone around the Spindle. There are around 2-3 zones with Templar forces in them without a legendary accompanying them that don't need to be killed for the quest to be completed, but why not clean the board of Templar?

There are actually 16 zones around the Spindle, which itself is an entire parasang. Make sure you circle the entire Spindle in order to discover all the forces brought by the Templar.

## Tackling the Templar

In total, there will be a Mk II mecha, a Grand Newfather, and 2 Knight Commanders that are legendary to deal with. Each one will have additional forces supporting them, including Newfathers, phylactery squires and mk I mechas. The forces each one has are random, so be prepared for anything. The Golem is more than capable of destroying all of the Templar forces on its own, but be sure to let it recover between fights as it is powerful but not immortal.

I won't make a mention of it in the individual combat sections, but keep in mind that the entire Spindle grounds are _outside_, which means if you have perfect flight (as is recommended), then you can use a ranged weapon to kill all melee combatants in perfect safety.

### The Knight Commanders

The two Knight Commanders are the same type of creature that led the raid in [A Call To Arms](./a-call-to-arms), and are hopefully much less dangerous to you at this point. To recap on their abilities, they will use Menacing Stare to fear you and have you lose control of your positioning and will try and lock you down with Shield Slam. Disarm via Dueling Stance + Lunge or Disarming Shot are extremely effective here and they can remove both the primary weapon of the Knight Commander _and_ the shield, removing the ability to Shield Slam.

Knight Commanders are often accompanied by temple mechas mk I, of which the mk Ia is the more threatening. The mk Ia is the melee variant and is extremely mobile and will use that mobility. Utilize the Golem to quickly focus and destroy any mk Ia mechas that appear. By this point in the game, you're likely to have extremely high DV and if not, your AV will be plenty to withstand the weaponry of the mk Ib mecha.

### The Grand Newfather

Grand Newfathers are amongst the most dangerous of the Templar forces as they will have 2-4 creature slaves under their command of tier 7-8. These could be anything from Soupy Sludges to Star Kraken, so be prepared for virtually anything the game can throw at you. With command of the Golem, you should be more than capable of handling any of these creatures. Be careful for any creatures capable of instant death or stunlocks; you'll want to disable them with freeze grenades, flashbang grenades, or other similar methods.

The Grand Newfather itself is much less of a threat, but still dangerous. They are melee combatants, so disarming them or keeping them at range handles them well, and if you are at the recommended AV they will struggle to do any damage at all.

### The Temple Mecha mk II

This is definitely the most serious combatant of them all. It is lethal in both melee and long range, so there is minimal opportunity to cheese its power. The best option is definitely to utilize the power of the Golem to fight it on more even ground, and a full-power Golem is certainly capable of taking on the mecha. Important to note that the mk II, like other mechas, is vulnerable to EMP so be sure to keep a few just in case of emergencies.

The Mecha mk II has several unique abilities. To begin the combat, it will fire a barrage of missiles around it. These have a rather large radius and are explosives, meaning they will bypass AV and DV and move terrain. A direct hit from one of these can easily rack up to over 100 damage, so be sure to avoid it. Even if you are outside of the alert markers from the missiles, you can still be damaged by the blast radius as it extends past the markers by a few tiles. It will continue to periodically fire missiles during the combat, so make sure you move enough to avoid them.

If you put too much distance between yourself and the mecha, not only will it just shoot at you the whole time, but it will also Jump at you and boy does it have hops. This Jump has a massive range on it (8 tiles or so) and will send out a stunning shockwave (mechanically similar to Stunning Force) from itself when it lands, which can give it a few turns to rip into your HP. Unless you're being forced to move due to a missile, it's best to stay close to avoid this leap. Staying close doesn't mean you're safe, however. The mechanical hull of the mecha will attempt to crush you, and can easily hit 20+ damage in a single penetration.

While it's _possible_ that the supplementing forces around the mecha are weak, it is not guaranteed. You can easily get multiple mecha mk I supporting the mk II. Without a rather powerful build and good game knowledge, it is definitely recommended to utilize the power of the Golem in order to take down the mk II in particular. Even the Golem can quickly be shredded by the mk II with bad positioning, so it is also recommended that you pilot the Golem in order to make the most use out of its power and to keep yourself secure.

## The Girsh Nephilim

Partway through the quest, the world will quake and you will receive a popup letting you know that a Girsh Nephilim has arrived to the Spindle in a direction. This can be a zone you've explored before or one you haven't, so it very well may arrive somewhere with a legendary Templar on it. The trigger is either when all Templar leaders are killed or a certain number of turns have passed (random), which also depends on which attempt it is (the higher the attempt number, the higher the turn delay). The Nephilim that arrives will be one that you haven't killed before, so if you've killed any of the Nephilim (or pacified them), then they won't arrive here and you can narrow your options. It's only really advised to narrow your options if you are attempting to kill all of the Nephilim as Qas & Qon and Shug'ruith can be difficult to find.

There are 6 Nephilim that can appear at the spindle:

-   Qas
-   Qon
-   Rermadon
-   Agolgot
-   Bethsaida
-   Shug'ruith

Each one has 4,000 HP, 60 in all resistances, and a special mutation called the Irisdual Beam, which is the primary gimmick of the Nephilim as a group. The Irisdual Beam is a special attack with a long cooldown that fires in 3 directions above 50% HP and 6 directions below 50% HP. There is 1 turn of windup for the beam before it fires, and at least 1 beam will target you directly. The beam does incredible damage if it connects and ignores DV and, to an extent, AV. The way the damage of the beam works is it has 7 damage types: Acid, Cold, Electric, Heat, Poison, Umbral and Cosmic. Umbral is the same damage type as Haggabah's hands, and Cosmic is the same damage type as a Chrome Pyramid's distortion field (melee attack). Umbral and Cosmic cannot be reduced in any way, but the other damage types absolutely can.

Each damage type can do 30 - 40 points of damage, and if you are hit by the beam you are hit by all 7 damage types simultaneously. If you have resistance to those damage types, you will take lower amounts of damage from the beam overall. However, as Umbral and Cosmic damage cannot be negated or reduced in any way, you will take damage from a minimum of 2 of the damage types. Poison damage can be negated only if you have Slogs annunclus, which can be obtained by Butchering the corpse of Slog. It can be reduced greatly by simply having Shake It Off and Poison Tolerance. If this wasn't bad enough, the beam projectile itself has a PV of 15 and can do 1d5 + 7 points of extra damage per penetration, so AV is very important in this fight.

All of this is to say, do **NOT** get hit by the beam, it hurts.

Once the Nephilim has begun to fire its Irisdual Beam, the beam will fire a total of 3 times before going on cooldown. This cannot be stopped in any way other than by killing or pacifying the Nephilim, and it is not recommended to be too close to the Nephilim when it activates its beam as beams tend to overlap at such a close range. Juke, Charge and Jump are excellent tools to use here to cover extra ground if necessary, so don't forget to use them. This is also why improved quickness and move speed scores are recommended here to ensure you don't fall victim to initiative orders and have a beam charge and fire before you get the chance to avoid it.

In addition to the Irisdual Beam, each Nephilim will occasionally spawn a creche underneath them, typically soon after firing its Irisdual Beam. Make sure to watch for this and to destroy it (they are extremely fragile), as failure to do so will spawn girshlings in accordance to which Nephilim dropped the creche. All Nephilim have Regeneration rank 10, so you cannot Decapitate them and they will quickly restore any Dismembered limbs.

### Qas

Qas is meant to be fought at the same time as her sister Qon, and by being brought to the Spindle she becomes an easier fight than normal. Still, Qas can be dangerous as any Nephilim can be dangerous, but she doesn't have any extra dangerous powers. She is only immune to confusion gas, so if you rely on Confusion or the confusing poison of Stinger to lower MA for psychic attacks, they will still work on Qas. Qas has 2 natural weapons, both being Cudgels. Care should be taken not to get stunned; padded gear is a great security. If you notice yourself being dazed, simply step away to shake off the daze and come back when it has worn off.

Qas is associated with polarized girshlings, which can create force fields around themselves.

### Qon

As we discussed with Qas, Qon is meant to be fought alongside her sister but instead can be fought alone if summoned to the Spindle. Qon has a unique gimmick in that all creatures that can see Qon will be constantly inflicted with confusion. Combine this with the Irisdual Beam and it can be _extremely_ lethal. It is highly recommended to have Iron Mind (or better yet, Two-Headed) to shake off the confusion. The confusion effect is a DC 25 Willpower save for every turn you have line of sight to Qon, and lasts from 10-15 turns. It may go without saying, but without Two-Headed your best bet is to take the Iron Mind skill and boost your Willpower with items like the psychodyne helmet. If you find yourself confused with the Irisdual Beam firing, you must be _extremely careful_ about your next steps. Ideally, you will have a source of flight that you can activate. If you can fly, you can retreat to the world map and wait out the duration of the confusion. This will result in Qon being in a new location when you return; potentially even a new zone but it is better than death.

Just to make things even more difficult, Qon can also fly. Qas really got the short end of the stick huh? If you don't have flight, you will be in a serious pit as all Nephilim have a reflective shield to divert projectiles until disabled with an EMP. Like Qas, Qon is _not_ immune to being confused outside of confusion gas, so you are able to utilize this to deal significant damage with mental attacks like with other Nephilim. Qon has one natural weapon which is an Axe. She does not have any Axe skills, so do not worry about dismemberment but critical hits can reduce your AV.

Qon is associated with cryptic girshlings, which release confusion gas upon death.

### Rermadon

Rermadon is luckily much less complex than Qon. They are immune to plasma so you won't be able to lower their resistances, but you can still damage them with other elemental damage types. In that sense, they are fairly similar to Qas, the main difference being in the girshlings associated and the weapon type of their natural weapon. Rermadon uses an Axe, but like other Nephilim does not have any skills to "properly" use it.

Rermadon is associated with plasmatic girshlings, which release plasma gas on death.

### Agolgot

Agolgot is another fairly simple Nephilim. He has 2 natural weapons which are Long Blades meaning they have extra PV on critical hits. Other than that, he spawns girshlings that have the capability to cause an ooze effect on hit: rusting an object, poison, or inflicting stiff legs/sore throat. Note that they do _not_ need to penetrate for this to take place. Since Agolgot will be fought on the surface in this instance, these girshlings are only capable of inflicting stiff legs. However, if you fight Agolgot in his lair (not during this quest), do note that they can inflict sore throat depending on the strata.

Agolgot is associated with rank girshlings, which can cause an ooze effect upon melee hit and drop a pool of ooze upon death.

### Bethsaida

I hope you weren't getting comfortable with the simpler Nephilim, because we've arrived at another tricky one. Bethsaida wields two Short Blade natural weapons, which cause bleeding upon critical hits. They have a simple yet effective gimmick: Bethsaida will clone themselves at 50% HP. This clone has all the power of the original, other than the fact that their Irisdual Beam will only fire 3 rays instead of 6. The clone will _also_ spawn creches of their own as well. The clone will be at 50% of its max HP, and Nephilim are not immune to the Irisdual Beam. Since they have hefty resistances, it won't do full damage but if you get Bethsaida or their clone to stand in the path of the other's Irisdual Beam, you can do upwards of 130 damage per beam.

Bethsaida is associated with conjoined girshlings, which split into 2 girshlings when killed.

### Shug'ruith

Finally, we come to Shug'ruith. Shug'ruith wields a single Cudgel as its weapon of choice, so deal with its melee similarly to Qas. It will always be inside of a wall and won't move around, so make sure you notice it. Since it will be inside of a wall, it won't actually be able to spawn its creches as long as the wall remains intact. Shug'ruith is therefore extremely vulnerable to gas grenades like plasma and corrosive gas as it will not move out of them.

Shug'ruith is associated with burrowing girshlings, which spawn wall tiles as they move underground.

### Utilizing the Golem

Since Barathrum will be inside the Golem with you, it is very important that the Golem stays alive, especially during this fight. _If you are not piloting the Golem, it will **very likely** be destroyed_. The damage of the Irisdual Beam is so great that it will easily tear through the Golem. If you plan on using the Golem against the Nephilim, pilot it for the best chance of both your survival and the Golem's. Otherwise, command it to stay behind so Barathrum survives. Once the Nephilim and the Templar leaders are dead, you'll be ready for the final quest of Qud.
