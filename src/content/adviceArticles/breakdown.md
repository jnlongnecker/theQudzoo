# Breaking Down a Run

---

There are far more items and enemies than I care to cover in this document, so instead of a comprehensive list of my opinions on all items and all enemies, instead I will share my thoughts on the way I break down a run in my mind and a glimpse into my internal checklist for the part of the game I’m currently on. This will include general thoughts and how I move through the section as well as enemies that I look to have a solution for as well as what that solution is. I’ll also include any equipment I look to have by this point and if they’re a must-have or a nice-to-have and any skills I prefer to have. Note that these are skills I look to have, not that I must have and not all are possible or even desirable depending on the build.

## Red Rock (Level 1-10)

The first section of the game revolves around the legendary quest to Red Rock. This is where most dreams are crushed instantly by a <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Flurry</span></span> of stones from baboons or the gnashing teeth of a legendary snapjaw. Included in this section are all the story quests from Argyve until A Canticle for Barathrum. This part of the game is highly volatile, and I usually play it pretty fast and loose since death here is pretty meaningless. I personally like to level up on baboons to 5-7 before clearing out Red Rock, then completing the Weirdwire Conduit immediately after.

## Grit Gate (Level 10-18)

The second section involves the quests just up to Decoding the Signal, all revolving around gaining access to the Barathrumite compound at Grit Gate. In this section, I spend most of my time preparing for Bethesda Susa as I’m already prepared for Golgotha from the previous section. In fact, there are some times that I’ve already gained access to Grit Gate in its entirety by this level. Regardless, after gaining access to Grit Gate I will go through the first Historic Site that can always be found from the statue in the zone north of Joppa, and then start leveling up through the jungle. Goatfolk and their villages are great places to find good loot in preparation for Bethesda Susa, and I’ll also start investigating the Six Day Stilt for Schrodinger pages and Eater’s Nectar in particular.

## Bethesda Susa (Level 18-26)

At the third section of the game, I’m ready to rock through Bethesda Susa and enter the make-or-break point of my runs. Success in this section typically results in the success of the run. By this point I’m very in tune with my build and how powerful it feels. Weaker builds will result in me taking things slower and prolonging this section, while particularly powerful builds will result in me pushing the boundaries here and accessing parts of the map early. Once I’ve completed the prior section, this section starts off with completion of Decoding the Signal and gutting Bethesda Susa of all XP possible. From there, I will spend the rest of my time leveling up and preparing the A Call to Arms, typically in the 3 days of waiting during The Earl of Omonporch. I’ll explore any Historic Site below Deep Jungle tier sites, but it’s important here not to get too overconfident. Ooze sites in particular are extremely dangerous at this tier and should likely be avoided.

## Endgame (Level 26-35)

Very suddenly, at this section of the game we gain access to extremely powerful weapons and equipment. This section starts out slow looking to avoid dangerous enemies and then quickly powers up to become capable of destroying any enemy in the game. The way I play my runs, I don’t like to end them until I’ve crossed off powerful enemies off of my kill checklist; usually this gets completed by the time I hit 35 even though I become capable of doing so typically around level 32-33. Depending on the relative power of the build, I may also prolong this section of the game; even up to level 40 (which is the latest I’ve ever completed this section). This section contains the completion of the Tomb of the Eaters quest and putting the bow on any primary build that I have going on, and may even start to see alternative backup builds beginning to bud and I really flesh out the stability of the character to take on any enemy in the game.

### Skill Wishlist - Endgame

Any final skills to complete my build; by now I tend to be looking for random things to improve my character’s overall power or start to branch into other weapons.

## Post-Game (Level 35+)

The final section of the game I typically don’t spend much time in. There are no new challenges to face here, and is (to me) the most uninteresting point of the game. If I decide to play this out and don’t just start a new run, then I try and push my build to the most unbelievable level. I have nothing I’m looking for in particular, just looking for every piece of equipment in the game for a running collection and seeing how far I can push the game. If you’ve made it here, you have full capability to annihilate anything in the game. By level 40, even the weakest of builds can be capable of defeating even the largest of threats.
