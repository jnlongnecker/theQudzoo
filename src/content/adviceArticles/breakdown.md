# Breaking Down a Run

---

There are far more items and enemies than I care to cover in this article, so instead of a comprehensive list of my opinions on all items and all enemies, instead I will share my thoughts on the way I break down a run in my mind and a glimpse into my internal checklist for the part of the game I’m currently on. This will include general thoughts and how I move through the section as well as enemies that I look to have a solution for as well as what that solution is. I'll also include any equipment I look to have by this point and if they're a must-have or a nice-to-have and any skills I prefer to have. Note that these are skills I look to have, not that I must have and not all are possible or even desirable depending on the build.

## Red Rock (Level 1-10)

The first section of the game revolves around the legendary quest to Red Rock. This is where most dreams are crushed instantly by a flurry of stones from baboons or the gnashing teeth of a legendary snapjaw. Included in this section are all the story quests from Argyve until A Canticle for Barathrum. This part of the game is highly volatile, and I usually play it pretty fast and loose since death here is pretty meaningless. I personally like to level up on baboons to 5-7 before clearing out Red Rock, then completing the Weirdwire Conduit immediately after.

This is also a place that I like to start setting up reputation for the future. During the search for mechanical wings & the oddly-hued glowpad, keep an eye out for lairs and explore every single one. Fish, insect and flower reputation are easily acquired here and snapjaw lairs are laden with loot and legendaries to kill for even more reputation.

### Notable Enemies - Red Rock

#### Slugsnout

<p class="section-info">Swift Reflexes, Charge, 12-13 DV or 6 AV</p>

Slugsnouts aren't actually that threatening if you know how to deal with them. The big problem is when they're able to shoot at you from a distance since they're pretty accurate and do a good amount of damage. Make sure to put something solid between you and them, and quickly close the gap. Once you're in melee, they will stop shooting making fighting them much easier.

## Grit Gate (Level 10-18)

The second section involves the quests just up to Decoding the Signal, all revolving around gaining access to the Barathrumite compound at Grit Gate. In this section, I spend most of my time preparing for Bethesda Susa as I’m already prepared for Golgotha from the previous section. In fact, there are some times that I’ve already gained access to Grit Gate in its entirety by this level. Regardless, after gaining access to Grit Gate I will go through the first Historic Site that can always be found from the statue in the zone north of Joppa, and then start leveling up through the jungle. Goatfolk and their villages are great places to find good loot in preparation for Bethesda Susa, and I’ll also start investigating the Six Day Stilt for Schrodinger pages and Eater’s Nectar in particular.

In this tier I start to leverage more reputation. Warden rep should be stacked pretty high by this point, and the Raising Indrix side quest can help a lot in both boosting reputation and gaining a strong weapon for Bethesda Susa. I gain Tinkering for reputation from the Barathrumites and Meal Preparation from Mayor Nuntu at Kyakukya.

I double the process of leveling up and gearing in goatfolk villages with traveling to Ezra and buying the recoiler there as you're bound to find a lot on the way. When you make it there, you can also check for good equipment from Sixshrew if you can afford it and gain Snake Oiler from Asphodel if you don't already have it. While you're in Ezra, don't forget to gain Customs and Folklore from Mayor Haddas. If you oil ritual Warden 1-FF first, you'll have enough for it when you water ritual Haddas.

### Notable Enemies - Grit Gate

#### Novice of the Sightless Way

<p class="section-info">-249 Seekers of the Sightless Way reputation, Harvestry + Meal Preparation, Berate, Menacing Stare, Flashbang grenades, Flaming Ray / Freezing Ray, Confusion, Damage reflection</p>

Sunder Mind on enemies is quite the thorn for inexperienced players and often spells the doom of the unprepared. Therefore, you should be prepared. Cooking with spine fruit jam can potentially give damage reflection, which will immediately stop Sunder Mind. Additionally, Berate and Menacing Stare are skills that can immediately break Sunder Mind and if you have a source of the confused effect like flashbang grenades or the Confusion mutation, this also breaks Sunder Mind.

The classic solve here is to either kill the novice or transition zones. Sprint + Charge can help close that distance, but Flaming Ray or Freezing Ray with a couple ranks in them do enough damage to 1-shot them from a distance since they don't have much HP.

#### Goatfolk Sower

<p class="section-info">Juke, Hologram Bracelet, Forcefield source, Defoliant grenades; solved primarily through positioning</p>

Sowers can be a bit of an issue for lower HP builds and especially a problem in groups. If you can manage getting into melee with them safely, they won't throw their seeds. They also won't throw their seeds if there is an ally of theirs in the way, so a lot of their threat can be mitigated or eliminated with good positioning. You can also get them to blow themselves up if you lock them behind a Force Wall, or reduce the damage to yourself by having a forcefield around yourself a-la Force Bubble or the force bracelet.

> You can obtain a force bracelet from Hindriarch Keh in Bey Lah by killing or trading with her.

An obscure yet very funny solve to goatfolk sowers is to simply toss defoliant grenades at them. This will detonate their sower seeds, causing them to blow themselves up. If all of the above fails, freezing them to get into a better position also works well. One thing to keep in mind is that if there are multiple sowers and you kill one that still had seeds in its inventory, _sower seed explosions that hit the dropped seeds will detonate the dropped seeds_. This is especially dangerous in lairs when there are potentially many seeds on the floor.

#### Slog of the Cloaca

<p class="section-info">-249 Mollusk reputation, Flamethrower, Chaingun</p>

Slog is a pretty nasty opponent and there's not many things that just outright stop him from doing his thing since "his thing" is just running up to you and hitting you. Of course if you're able to maintain the gap while doing damage you'll take him out. Something notable is if you encounter Slog while near the elevator out of the cloaca is you can begin flying while standing on the platform. This will make yourself invincible against Slog (unless you fall).

Having a single snail-encrusted piece of gear will make Slog neutral to you (unless you've been naughty and dropped mollusk reputation). Alternatively, if you have Two-Headed or have gained a bit of mollusk rep already, the electric snail shell gives mollusk reputation and can be found at the Stilt from snail ranchers. A love injector is also quite handy to use since mollusk reputation is useful and Slog will go on a rampage for you and kill everything in the cloaca.

If you're set on killing Slog, make sure you've got good gear. As outlined above, a flamethrower or chaingun are so powerful at this point they will easily take out Slog if you have the ammunition.

## Bethesda Susa (Level 18-26)

At the third section of the game, I’m ready to rock through Bethesda Susa and enter the make-or-break point of my runs. Success in this section typically results in the success of the run. By this point I’m very in tune with my build and how powerful it feels. Weaker builds will result in me taking things slower and prolonging this section, while particularly powerful builds will result in me pushing the boundaries here and accessing parts of the map early. Once I’ve completed the prior section, this section starts off with completion of Decoding the Signal and gutting Bethesda Susa of all XP possible. From there, I will spend the rest of my time leveling up and preparing for A Call to Arms, typically in the 3 days of waiting during The Earl of Omonporch. I’ll explore any Historic Site below Deep Jungle tier sites, but it’s important here not to get too overconfident. Ooze sites in particular are extremely dangerous at this tier and should likely be avoided.

Also included in that waiting period during The Earl of Omonporch is a trip to the Yd Freehold to get the recoiler and check the inventory of Tillifergaewicz and my favorite character Bep. The outskirts of Yd also have palladium struts that you can search through for sunslag, so don't forget to autoexplore them for that goodness potential. Additionally, I like to try and find a couple goatfolk haunts in the Deep Jungle since the qlippoths are actually not very difficult to kill post Bethesda Susa and have crysteel tier gear. You'll also often find step sowers here which are very useful for A Call to Arms.

### Notable Enemies - Bethesda Susa

#### Rimewyk

<p class="section-info">-249 Unshelled Reptile reputation, 70+ Cold Resistance, Weathered, 24+ Agility</p>

Rimewyk are one of the most unusually dangerous creatures for their tier. The cold ray they fire is _way_ stronger than Freezing Ray and is nearly guaranteed to instantly freeze you. Then their bite (which is very accurate) does a ton of cold damage. If you have high cold resistance, then these threats become a lot less scary. Additionally, abilities that can be activated while frozen like Corrosive Gas Generation and Force Bubble can help conserve resources if you get hit unexpectedly.

If you have a single piece of scaled gear, this will take you above -249 reputation with unshelled reptiles and turn these death machines on the rest of the Bethesda Susa residents, and they are very effective. Definitely keep one if you find it in your journey for this occasion. If all else fails and you've got rimewyk baring down on you while frozen, pop a blaze injector. This will unfreeze you, but it will make you very susceptible to cold damage so make sure you're careful if you choose to fight the rimewyk while it's still active.

#### Cragmensch

<p class="section-info">9 PV weapon, Elemental damage, Penetrating Strikes, 10+ AV</p>

Cragmensch are interesting because they're either really threatening and annoying or complete fodder. If you have the capability of damaging them reliably, you will easily clear them. If you don't, well you're in for a rough time. 9 PV is the minimum here, but you definitely want something better. Vibro weapons are obviously extremely good here as are elemental damage sources since they get past the massive AV of the cragmensch.

Don't forget to equip the boulder they drop on death and toss it aside, as cragmensch do actually drop loot. It's just usually covered by the boulder.

#### Gyrohumor

<p class="section-info">Reliable Ranged weapon, -249 Ooze reputation, Penetrating Strikes, Stunning capabilities, 16+ DV</p>

Gyrohumor are the pure melee, variant element alternative to rimewyk. They will constantly change elemental type, which does also change their resistances. Essentially, you're really not looking to melee with them unless you can dodge them reliably or keep them locked down reliably so they're not hitting you. Unless you have very high cold resistance, don't engage with them in their cold form since they can potentially freeze you and keep you very locked down.

#### Stat Sap

<p class="section-info">Sparbine, 15 AV, 250 Winged Mammal reputation, Sight through walls</p>

These guys are very common in the Deep Jungle and the bane of many novice players. Truthfully, they aren't actually that bad but you need to treat them with respect. They are easily instantly killed by even mid power ranged weapons like the Sparbine, but the trick is seeing them coming through the mess of the Deep Jungle. It's usually just not worth exploring random zones in the Deep Jungle because of this.

If you have high AV, they have to penetrate in order to drain your stats and their PV is actually quite low. Don't rely too much on this though, because there's always a chance they get through. If you have vision that goes through obstacles like the Penetrating Radar or night-sight interpolators then these guys become a non-threat.

#### Dervish/High Dervish of the Sightless Way

<p class="section-info">-249 Seekers of the Sightless Way reputation, Disarm, Stunning capabilities, Enhanced quickness/movement speed, Reliable Ranged weapon</p>

Treat these guys with respect since your MA is probably not great. Try and make sure they're not allowed to go to work in melee with you and you'll be fine. Disarm them with Lunge + Dueling Stance or Disarming Shot or keep them locked down with Cudgel skills or high ranked Double-muscled.

#### Twinning Lamprey

<p class="section-info">-249 Fish reputation, Normality gas, Sparbine, Freeze ray, Freeze grenades</p>

Twinning lamprey are more annoying than a threat since they are easily killed individually, but killing the pair is the trick. At this point you probably don't have an amazing source of normality, which means you'll have to stop them twinning in another way. Alternatively, you can actually get both low and then hit them both with a single shot of the Sparbine to kill them both at the same time.

If that fails, then make sure you come with freeze capabilities, stun capabilities, and/or sleep capabilities. All 3 will stop the remaining lamprey from twinning when it's pair dies, but I recommend freeze because you're likely to inflict yourself with stun or sleep while hitting the lamprey.

If you happen to have it, an ontological anchor dropped to the floor is a cute source of a normality field that will prevent twinning. Likely you don't have it, but in case you run into these guys when you do it's an option.

## Tomb of the Eaters (Level 26-35)

Very suddenly, at this section of the game we gain access to extremely powerful weapons and equipment. This section starts out slow looking to avoid dangerous enemies and then quickly powers up to become capable of destroying any enemy in the game. The way I play my runs, I don’t like to end them until I’ve crossed off powerful enemies off of my kill checklist; usually this gets completed by the time I hit 35 even though I become capable of doing so typically around level 32-33. This section contains the completion of the Tomb of the Eaters quest and putting the bow on any primary build that I have going on, and may even start to see alternative backup builds beginning to bud and I really flesh out the stability of the character to take on any enemy in the game.

### Notable Enemies - Tomb of the Eaters

#### Red Jell/Purple Jell/Zero Jell

<p class="section-info">-249 Ooze reputation, Forcefield source, Ranged weapons, Enhanced quickness/movement speed</p>

These three are actually quite similar; red jells deal heat damage and leaves behind lava, purple jells deal acid damage and leaves acid mixed with wine behind, and zero jells apply dilute warm static effects and leave behind dilute warm static. The raw damage they do is actually not really the concern, it's the liquids they bleed and leave behind on death. Acid and lava can quickly destroy your nonmetal gear while dilute warm static can do literally any effect. Therefore, it is recommended for you to have a way to kite them around and kill them with ranged attacks.

If you strap up with all lacquered gear, this will actually prevent the bulk of the issue from purple and red jells since lava and acid are only a concern if they can stain your gear which lacquered prevents. Zero jells will unfortunately still apply their effects, so you still will want to fight them at range.

In all honesty, red and purple jells are easy _enough_ to kill with ranged weapons, but zero jells you should probably just avoid. They're very tanky and they can take a while to kill, so probably best to just avoid them. Notable with the jells is that they do not posses any ranged attacks, so if you encounter them on the surface then you can kill them in safety with flight.

#### Svardym Eld

<p class="section-info">Mental Mirror, Enhanced quickness/movement speed, Quartzfur equipment, Forcefield destruction/bypass ability, Berate, Flashbang grenades, Freeze grenades, 15+ AV</p>

Svardym eld are kinda a crapshoot of mental mutations. Sometimes, they roll things completely useless like Kindle. Other times, they roll very deadly mutations like Light Manipulation or Sunder Mind. Due to the large Ego bonus of elds, their already high rank mental mutations are further boosted to deadly levels.

Therefore, while technically you need to be prepared for any mental mutation, it's really Light Manipulation, Sunder Mind, Syphon Vim, and Force Wall that need consideration. Sunder Mind brings back all the classics from the novice of the sightless way. Light Manipulation is solved with light reflection like the refractive mod or rainboweave cloak (or Light Manipulation of your own), and Syphon Vim is solved by just killing the eld. I bring it up just because you need to be aware that this is something they can do, so be sure only to engage an eld in melee when you know you can kill it since there is no way to break Syphon Vim.

Force Wall is a unique one, since at the levels that the elds have they can often trap you in a baby cage indefinitely. You therefore need a way to escape. The Force Modulator cybernetic is great to have, as are strong vibro weapons like the vibro blade or ceremonial vibrokhopesh.

Teleportation of any form will get the job done; whether you have the mutation, a cybernetic, or from displacement. A mercurial cloak, displacer mod, or displacer bracelet can all get you out by attacking yourself with it equipped. I've also found that electric damage can work well enough on forcefields since they aren't immune; you just need to be aware of the potential self damage from the arcs. Finally, normality from any source will disable forcefields.

#### Galgal

<p class="section-info">Forcefield source, 270+ Movement Speed, Perfect Flight + 25 DV, High-Voltage Arc Winders, Penetrating Strikes, Corrosive Gas Generation, Anchor spikes, -249 Robot reputation</p>

Galgal are amongst the most dangerous creatures in all of Qud. It is no exaggeration that they are the one creature that has genuinely stumped me on what to do for longer than any other, but fear not because I come to you today with solves.

First off, if you are traversing the Palladium Reef you **must have** EMP mk III grenades on hand in spades. For a lot of your time there, you simply will not be equipped to deal with a galgal and should instead EMP it as soon as you find one. A mk II or lower is simply not sufficient because of their extremely high quickness. If they have higher quickness than you (which they almost certainly do), the effect of the EMP _lasts shorter_ than described because the duration is based off of the _creatures_ perceived turns, not "global" turns.

Fighting a galgal is a different question entirely, but it can be done. First off, you need a proper way of damaging it. Galgal can be stunned, so Cudgel builds can sometimes be sufficient to stunlock them if you are able to get into melee with them. For you to be doing this reliably, you'll need a high quickness score (175+), which isn't feasible for many builds. More easily obtained is perfect flight and 25 DV.

Galgal have 2 weapons: their run over ability which knocks you prone on hit and has a 1 turn delay and their naser cannon. The naser cannon applies normality and grounds you, but if you have 25 DV and Swift Reflexes they cannot hit you with it. This means with the aforementioned + perfect flight, you can kill them in complete safety as long as you're on the surface. If you pop up a forcefield around them or yourself, they can still punch through it with run over if it's already charged. They will also fire the naser cannon if you activate forcefields otherwise, so you're not safe in there.

If you encounter one underground, you're a lot more limited in your options. The run over ability will pass them through every tile in their path, which means galgal are _extremely_ susceptible to damaging gas. Corrosive Gas Generation can easily kill a galgal due to this fact, and clouds of plasma are also very effective. Something else to consider is that galgal are only _resistant_ to cold, not immune. Mk III freeze grenades _will_ freeze them in place, as will EMP grenades of course. The benefit of freeze grenades however is that they will _also_ reduce the quickness of the galgal, making keeping them locked down much easier.

Alternatively, a build with good quickness (150+) and/or high movement speed (270+) can actually dodge between the run over charges and counterattack with pistols. Action cost reduction through Empty the Clips or Fastest Gun in the Rust are fantastic here to give more room for you to go to work with (ideally) high-capacity arc winders and tear through the galgal.

If all else fails, when you are out of run over range the galgal will often times prioritize the naser cannon over approaching (especially if there is a forcefield). You can abuse this to get in a ranged fight with the galgal with arc winders; a fight you are far more likely to win.

#### Trining Lamprey

<p class="section-info">Normality Grenades mk III, Freeze Grenades mk III, Freeze ray, Ontological anchor, -249 Fish reputation</p>

Trining lamprey and just twinning lamprey on steroids. You deal with them in the same way, except killing all 3 simultaneously is basically impossible without planning and explosives. Just freeze them and kill them, should be pretty easy at this point in the game.

#### Gamma Moth

<p class="section-info">25+ DV, Swift Reflexes, -249 Insect reputation, Rank 5 Regeneration, Black mote</p>

The problem with gamma moths is that they will appear when you least expect it and drop a mutating deuce on your face and die soon after. They can appear underground and in tier 7+ forgotten ruins uncommonly, so if you are exploring these areas make sure you have 25 DV and Swift Reflexes or -259+ insect reputation. Alternatively, a black mote is capable of deleting the projectile so if you have one you may get lucky on it deleting the gaze projectile.

If you have rank 5 Regeneration, this will allow you to heal the mutating effect. You can also cure it through ubernostrum or a regeneration tank. If those fail, then one of the soul curd triggered effects that removes a major debuff can also cure mutating. If all else fails, just cross your fingers to roll the 20%.

I'll mention it here, but the gaze is EMP sensitive. The problem is they will fire it off the instant they see you in nearly every instance, so usually you'll already be hit by it before you can EMP. If you see one first and it's in EMP range, either pop a forcefield or pop that EMP.

Those of you with a form of Precognition can also farm gamma moths for mutations and mutation points safely by rerolling undesired mutation results, or just opt to get every defect and deal with that anyway. It's not recommended, as farming warm static is a strictly superior method since you have a lot more control and don't have to get any defects, but you have options.

#### Mirror Bug

<p class="section-info">Phasing, Vibro Weapons, -249 Insect reputation, Juke</p>

Mirror bugs have perfect damage reflection, and killing them with the hit doesn't prevent that. In isolation, mirror bugs probably won't kill you because they just do no damage. The problem is that they are so weak you are likely to kill yourself. It's therefore recommended you have a weak weapon like a carbine to clear out mirror bugs to allow you to get to the quartziferous mirror to stop the spawning of them.

The real threat is combining mirror bugs with other threats, especially if you have less control over your AOE like with Corrosive Gas Generation or electrical modded weapons. Be careful with them and you should be good, but don't take them lightly. If you start to see particle effects of creatures spawning, go right there to cut off the source as early as possible.

#### Leering Stalker

<p class="section-info">Ceremonial Vibrokhopesh, Electricity modded weapons, Penetrating Strikes, 25 DV, Stunning capabilities, -249 Robot reputation, Corrosive Gas Generation, High-Voltage Arc Winders, Decapitate, Disarm capabilities</p>

Leering stalker can be quite annoying with their blast cannon as they just spam it out with blatant disregard for your gameplay experience. If you have Disarming Shot then you can stop this from a distance otherwise you'll need to close the gap. Once in melee, it won't shoot the blast cannon anymore but you might as well take it out for the bits, right?

They have hefty armor, so a way to bypass this is key for fighting them. As robots, they are also extremely susceptible to electric damage so if you don't have Penetrating Strikes (or even if you do), electrified modded weapons are greatly effective. They can do a good bit of damage, but if you have high AV then they actually aren't much of a threat once you get in melee.

Something important to note is that leering stalker do have a head and they don't have Regeneration 10, so you can Decapitate them. If you have Berserk! especially, they are pretty trivial to beat with a Single Weapon Fighting Axe build.

#### Chrome Pyramid

<p class="section-info">Ceremonial Vibrokhopesh, Electric damage, Electricity modded weapons, Corrosive Gas Generation, Spaser rifle, 25 DV and Swift Reflexes, Point-defense drone, -249 Robot reputation</p>

Oof, the chrome pyramid. So legendary in the Qud zeitgeist, but honestly not very threatening once you know what you're doing.

The chrome pyramid really has 1 gimmick and once you defeat that, it becomes a huge sack of hitpoints that hits hard in melee and takes up healing items. That gimmick is of course the swarm rack missile shotgun. It will continue to fabricate missiles at the cost of its own health if it ever runs out, and it will run out. However, we can use that to our advantage.

You see, I've mentioned it before but if you have 25 DV and Swift Reflexes, non-legendary creatures _cannot hit you with ranged attacks_. The only reason legendary creatures _potentially_ can is because they have increased Agility. Chrome pyramids are no exception, you can simply stand next to them so you're not hit by the splash of the explosions hitting things around you and wait for them to reduce their HP by fabricating missiles.

Once they're too low to continue to fabricate, they will approach and eventually pin you against a wall where they attack in melee. At this point, you use things like EMP grenades, freeze grenades, and stun capability to lock them down while you finish the rest of their HP with your melee attacks (hopefully with electric damage modded on).

If you want to fight back to reduce their HP faster while they miss over and over, you can fire off high-capacity arc winder and spaser rifle shots which can punch through the forcefield and even destroy it. If you have Corrosive Gas Generation, it works wonders if you are able to drag the chrome pyramid into the area of effect. Additionally, if you can catch the chrome pyramid on a corner, you can get it to hit itself with its own missiles.

If you _don't_ have 25 DV, well now you've got a problem. In this case, fighting back is probably secondary to simply escaping with an EMP grenade. If you do want to fight back, you'll want a point-defense drone to take out the missiles. To help it do this, make sure you're standing as far back as possible. The point-defense drone can sometimes fail to defend against the missile, miss, or shoot it down too late and still catch you in the explosion. Compute power helps with this, so pairing with a palladium mesh tabard is recommended if possible.

I'd recommend _not_ using a black mote, as the chrome pyramid fires so many projectiles you're bound to get teleported away. Come prepared with EMP grenades, plasma, and high-capacity arc winders. Be ready for a long fight; you'll eventually win if you keep the above in mind but it may cost quite a bit of resources.

#### Cherubim

<p class="section-info">EMP Grenades mk III, Explosives, Freeze grenade mk III, Level 6 Wings, 24 AV, Enhanced Quickness, 300 Movement speed, Corrosive Gas Generation, Mental attacks, Stunning capabilities, Decapitate</p>

Before we begin, know that there are a lot of different kinds of cherubim but the most dangerous are robot cherubs, baetyl cherubs and ooze cherubs. The rest are mostly the same, with a couple being weaker than average. The strategy that you use does somewhat depend on the modifier of the cherubs; for example you cannot freeze ice cherubs without plasma.

Each cherub has a reflective shield, which will bounce back any projectile (shot or thrown) that hits it. This is susceptible to EMP, so if you are opting for range you'll need to come with quite a few EMP grenades. Most cherubs have no elemental resistance, so elemental damage is highly effective (especially electric for mechanical cherubs). The non-mechanical cherubs are also organic, so suceptible to all things organics are susceptible to (love injector, mental attacks, etc).

Each cherub has enhanced quickness (115 organic 105 mechanical) and movement speed (150 organic 125 mechanical), with a couple having lower or even won't move at all. Bird and bat cherubim fly, so you'll need to be aware of that as well. This means that you ideally want to fight them 1 at a time and you'll need to make sure you have the necessary speed to get away to a good fighting position. Assuming you're fighting in the sultan burial chambers, you'll either want to set up a position with 3d cobblers or drag the cherub to the side chambers since there is a chokepoint you can use there.

Despite their low cold resistance, cherubs are capable of rapidly heating themselves up when frozen. Unfortunately for them, mk III freeze grenades are so potent this matters little as long as you're not afraid to get hit with it yourself. If you have 100 cold resistance, liberal application of freeze grenades easily takes care of any non ice cherub. This is the recommended approach for the dangerous modifiers of jeweled, chaotic and mighty.

Barring that, you can also lock them down with stun capabilities; Cudgels perform quite well here. Additionally, no cherubs have Regeneration 10 and all of them have heads, so they are extremely prone to Decapitation especially with Berserk!. If you have 300 move speed, you can kite them around reliably enough to where you don't have to worry too much as long as you stay stocked with EMP grenades or explosives. They are also quite susceptible to the classic wombo-combo of a mk III plasma grenade into a mk III gravity grenade.

This final section involves wrapping up the game and deciding if the easy dub should be taken or if the build should fight Ehalcodon. By this point, you should have a strong enough build that fighting a single Nephilim is a perfectly reasonable task; at worst fighting Qon might be a struggle. Even if you yourself may not be capable of it, you should have a Golem that can handle it for sure.

If you are fighting Ehalcodon, I've written quite a bit on the topic (you can find that [here](/advice/quests/reclamation#starformed-ehalcodon)) to help you out that I won't rehash here. Even if you aren't fighting Ehalcodon, the strategies I talk about here are still very helpful no matter what/which Nephilim you choose to fight.

There's not much to say about the game at this point; if you've made it here you certainly have enough knowledge to beat the game even if you don't always succeed. Don't be discouraged too much about a late death, as there are always things in Qud that can kill even the most veteran players. I would know, I still die on the occasion.
