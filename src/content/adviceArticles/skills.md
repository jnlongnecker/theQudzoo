# Skills

---

Skills are the unsung hero of Caves of Qud. In fact, I’d argue that your skills are more important than both your gear and your mutations/cybernetics. While not as obviously powerful as exploding some dude’s head with your mind, skills shape your run in the more subtle, less appreciated ways that are nonetheless extremely important. Here, I’ll be covering all the skills in the game and analyzing when I would want to have that skill: Early Game (levels 1-20), Mid Game (levels 20-30), or Late Game (levels 30+). For weapon skills, I will be assuming that this weapon plays into your primary weapon build. I will also cover factions that teach the skill and if it’s worth it to learn it that way or learn it with skill points if applicable. Finally, if I think the skill is not worth the skill points I will make mention of that.

## Acrobatics

### Swift Reflexes

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 75

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Cats (Not Worth)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Swift Reflexes</span></span> is one of those must-have skills and is the intro skill to the <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Acrobatics</span></span> tree. +5 to your <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> against ranged weapons is incredibly useful to have and while it won’t save you if you just dump <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span>, this skill makes it so you can perfectly avoid all projectiles at 25 <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> or more, which is a reliable <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> to have by end game. Of course, it’s useful before that since we’re bound to be shot quite a bit on our journey to the end game, so avoiding those projectiles means you’ll get there more often.

### Spry

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Free +2 <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span>, this is an incredible skill. Take this always, literally always.

### Jump

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Frogs, Svardym (Frogs Not Worth, Svardym Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Legendary Frogs are actually not so easy to find while legendary Svardym lairs are decently common and you’ll probably want Svardym rep anyways so if you don’t have <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> by then, it’s worth the pickup. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> moves you two squares in a single turn, but you can’t <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> over any creatures so while it’s an inferior engage tool to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> is more defensive in nature or can give you that extra bump to be able to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> in. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> is functionally similar to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span>, just not quite as good and with a longer cooldown. The primary reason to use <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> therefore is to extend your gap between an enemy or to cross hazardous pools of liquid and pits.

This skill also synergizes with <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/wings.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Wings</span></span> as they greatly increase the distance you can <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> with mutation level, and if you for some reason want to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> further as a true-kin you can install Pneumatic Pistons.

### Tumble

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This skill just buffs <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> and gives 1 <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span>, and we’re really taking this for the <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span>. Every free point of <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> you get is points you can put to <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> instead and make yourself as durable as possible. You want <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> anyway since it’s a good skill, so getting to reduce its cooldown and give that <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> is just more incentive to get <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span>.

## Axes

### Axe Proficiency

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

A permanent +2 to hit is quite good actually, and is one of the more noticeable weaknesses of <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span>. This allows you to focus mainly on <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> for your build and still have a reliable chance to hit (as long as you don’t dump <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>). Being the base skill for <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Axes</span></span>, you’re gonna have to get this one if you plan on using them seriously.

### Charging Strike

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> is arguably the best melee skill in the game and skills that synergize directly with it like this are part of the reason why. Double the chance to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dismember</span></span> and our <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Cleaves</span></span> are more deadly if they land. Passive benefit that you’ll get a lot of mileage out of.

### Cleave

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This skill really incentivises you to use as many hands as possible with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Axes</span></span> and pump your <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> up as high as you can as you can very quickly shred apart the armor of enemies. Even early game, cleaving off even just 1 or 2 <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> can result in more penetrations and deceptively higher damage. While this skill is not enough for you to rip apart the very highest armored enemies in the game, against anything less you’ll shred them to pieces quite fast.

### Dismember

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Cleave</span></span> a few times then hit <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dismember</span></span> to permanently cripple your enemy. If you chop off their main limb, you may just win the fight outright. Added chance to just do this on normal attacks as well and you can find yourself able to fight and kill enemies beyond what your stats would normally suggest. It’s random what limb you chop off so success is likely but not exactly reliable which is the one real drawback of this skill; don’t rely on it to save you.

### Hook and Drag

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No (Sometimes)

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Hook and Drag</span></span> is pretty underrated; but it is one skill I’m willing to sacrifice if I need the skill points elsewhere. You essentially have up to 9 rounds of guaranteed hits on an enemy, which can be very powerful on enemies that have high <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span>. If you have decent <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>, then this becomes redundant since you just hit all the time anyways so then it’s really just used to attack an enemy as you bring them somewhere which isn’t usually any functionally different than just moving there and then picking up combat where you left off.

This changes when you have significantly enhanced movement speed, as now <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Hook and Drag</span></span> lets you attack as fast as you can move which synergizes very well with <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/multipleLegs.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Multiple Legs</span></span>. So unless you have <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/multipleLegs.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Multiple Legs</span></span> or very poor <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>, you can probably give this a miss for your build.

### Decapitate

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

A low chance to just win the fight immediately (on most enemies). It’s not reliable mind you, but happens often enough to be very nice. A surprising number of things need a head, so don’t sleep on trying to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dismember</span></span> everything you fight; it may be far more effective than you think.

### Berserk!

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

By the time you get this, you should have a powerful enough build already where this skill is nice but not exactly required. Because of this and the massive skill point investment, I’ll often avoid taking this until I don’t have any other helpful skills to take anymore. Make no mistake though,  is extremely powerful and can nearly guarantee your victory against a single enemy.

The duration on it is very bad, but 5 rounds is really all you need for most enemies. Even if they survive, unless none of your attacks penetrate they will be so crippled the fight should just be over. Just don’t expect this skill to give you the win against every enemy in the game.

## Bow and Rifle

### Draw a Bead/Steady Hands

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

You get both of these at the same time, so I’ll analyze them together. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Steady Hands</span></span> just makes you more accurate, which if you’re using Bows/Rifles then you’re gonna want that. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span> makes you even more accurate by spending a turn. If you’ve got a lot of space between you and your target, this is good and especially useful earlier in the game. Once you get highly accurate guns and high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> you’ll stop using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span> for the accuracy and instead use it in conjunction with other <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Bow and Rifle</span></span> skills. As the intro skills, these are super useful to anyone using these weapons.

### Suppressive Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

By spamming this you can lock an enemy down indefinitely. The shot does have to penetrate which means enemies with high <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> will be able to shrug it off, but for all others this just gives you a practically free win against a melee enemy. It’s very good, if only all the other <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Bow and Rifle</span></span> skills were similar this would actually be a cool tree worthy of investment.

### Sure Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

You lose your mark to fire 1 (one!) shot that is guaranteed to hit. Most rifles have fairly high accuracy anyways so any rifle worth using better than a Carbine is getting virtually no benefit from this anyways since it wasn’t going to miss with the boost from both <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Draw a Bead</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Steady Hands</span></span>. It’s not like 150 skill points is a trivial cost either, this is quite expensive. Get something better.

### Wounding Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

You cause a bleed for each penetration you do and lose your mark. You’re probably only penetrating 3-5 times max, so that’s a 3-5 damage bleed that the enemy can save from for the cost of your mark. This is pathetic, the cost is too high for too small a benefit.

### Kickback

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

If you use guns as your primary weapon, this is actually quite good as it’ll give you space for more shots. If you combine this with liberal use of <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Suppressive Fire</span></span>, you can be incredibly hard to reach and very evasive.

### Disorienting Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Even if the effect from this skill was worth the cost (200 skill points with 250 skill points of skill prerequisites), you only get this benefit if the target cannot see or hear any allies; so virtually never unless this is the last enemy. What do we get for this? -4 <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="stat">MA</span></span>. Most enemies aren’t that hard to hit so the <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> is pretty useless and unless you’re using lots of mental attacks against the last enemy, the <span class="injected"><span class="stat">MA</span></span> is also pretty useless. Not worth the investment.

### Beacon Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

You need to ignite your enemy for this to work, which can be done if you’re willing to liberally use Thermal Grenades but all you get from this is your shot critting. If you spend the turns you would need to mark the target and throw the grenade, you’d be doing more damage than if you use this skill. If your target is so ignited that it’s locked in place, who cares about a crit it’s probably dead soon anyways.

### Flattening Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

The effect of this is insanely good, in fact it’s one of the best skill effects in the game. It not only locks them in place, but also knocks them prone and disarms them. So why is it not worth it? Well, in order to gain this benefit the enemy must have 6 walls surrounding them. In case you can’t visualize what that means, it means they must be in a 1 tile wide corridor in order for this to work. If you want to meticulously construct corridors for yourself and lure enemies in there to use this skill, go ahead. Otherwise, most of the time you won’t even be able to use this.

### Ultra Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

If there was more than 1 fire ability that was worth it, this would be an insane skill. Unfortunately, they’re all trash so you should give this a miss as well.

## Cooking and Gathering

### Meal Preparation

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Villagers of Kyakukya (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Being able to gain cooking effects is run changing and very important for any successful run. Cooking is not my preferred way to play as managing ingredients and rerolling when I get an effect I don’t want is annoying and tedious for me, so instead I usually just use ingredients that have 1 or 2 effects in order for me to more reliably get the one I want. So unless I’m using an ingredient like Spine Jam or Phase Silk I usually just go for jerky for <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/HP.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">HP</span></span> effects.

This is an admittedly simplistic approach to cooking and you can get some very strong effects, but I won’t pretend to have extensive knowledge over that. Even if you just follow my approach of spamming <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/HP.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">HP</span></span> increase cooking effects, this is still a very good skill you should have in every run.

### Harvestry

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Villagers of Joppa (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

If you’re planning on doing a lot of cooking, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Harvestry</span></span> is going to be one of your primary ways of getting good ingredients. Even if you’re not planning on doing much cooking, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Harvestry</span></span> is still useful in getting monetarily valuable ingredients and the coveted Yondercane for an escape tool. In the very early game it’s also quite good for getting you some extra Witchwood Bark in case you get put in one too many dangerous scenarios.

### Butchery

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Cannibals (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Butchery</span></span> is the second main way of getting your ingredients. Not only can you get valuable ingredients from <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Butchering</span></span> corpses, the ingredients you get here are typically much more expensive than ones you get from <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Harvestry</span></span> at the cost of being heavier. Further still, you can butcher certain types of corpses for valuable items (ogre apes, kaleidoslugs, quartz baboons, etc). Don’t bother wasting time grinding Cannibal rep for this, just spend the 50 skill points. Be careful with this if you don’t have <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Meal Preparation</span></span>, since many Butchered ingredients can be quite heavy when unprocessed.

### Spicer

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Denizens of Yd Freehold (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Since I don’t really use many cooking effects in general, I’ve got even less experience combining 3 or more ingredients for the effects. But you can get this for rep from Yd Freehold and there’s nothing else to do for that faction rep so might as well.

### Carbide Chef

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Using this, you’re actually able to control what cooking effects you get. If you can get a good amount of ingredients, and especially if you combine this with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Spicer</span></span>, you can get some very powerful cooking effects with perfect reliability. If you’re planning on sophisticated cooking, this is a very useful skill to have.

## Cudgel

### Cudgel Proficiency

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

+2 to hit is pretty big, just like it is for <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Axes</span></span>. Being the intro skill for <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span>, if you’re interested in seriously using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span> at all then this is a must-have.

### Bludgeon

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This skill is the single thing that makes <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span> good. Daze and Stun are both some of the best and most reliable debuffs to put on an enemy, and having a 50% chance at that is pretty huge. Combine this with <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/doubleMuscled.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Double-muscled</span></span> and not only do you have the synergy from the extra <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>, but you also get an even better chance to Daze and Stun. It’s not uncommon for many <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Cudgel</span></span> builds to be capable of permanently or nearly permanently stunning all enemies, which is good because <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Cudgel</span></span> damage is pretty awful.

### Charging Strike

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Start off the fight with a free daze? Potentially even a stun? Incredible, very good skill. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> remains a critical part of every melee build, super worth it.

### Conk

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Apes (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

It’s an activated skill, but the cooldown is incredibly short and gives you a free daze or stun. If they’re already stunned, you can actually just put them out of commission for the whole fight in case you’re being attacked by multiple enemies. As long as you don’t attack them, they’ll stay down for an incredibly long time giving you plenty of room to clear out any other attackers.

### Backswing

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Not only does this just flat out increase your DPS by 25%, but it also gives you more chances to daze and stun since you’re attacking more times with a <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Cudgel</span></span>. Great skill to have, seriously improves your fighting abilities.

### Slam

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This is the first <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Cudgel</span></span> skill that I will often skip out on. It’s not that it’s a bad skill, it’s just not quite as good as the rest. The problem with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> is that it pushes away your opponent which is usually not what you want to do. If you don’t engage with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>, then you can follow up a <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> with a <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> and is quite effective, but you should probably have just engaged with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>. If there’s just one enemy, this combo is quite good but when there are multiple enemies, you can’t follow up on the <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> quite as effectively.

### Demolish

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

I’m mixed on <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Demolish</span></span>, but by the time you can get it you’re probably not needing the 100% daze chance because you’re either already near permanently stunning everything or you have Precision Nanon Fingers and already have a 150% chance to daze anyways. The fact that you need <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> to get it as well means you need to spend the skill points on <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> which is only arguably worth it to begin with, and having no cooldown on <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> is pretty tough to make full use out of since <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Demolish</span></span> only lasts 5 turns and the whole point of <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> is that you push away the enemy. Can it be good? Yea, it can. Is it really a vital part of a <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Cudgel</span></span> build? Not at all.

## Customs and Folklore

### Tactful

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Villagers of Ezra (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

While you shouldn’t really ever purchase this with skill points, it’s always worth the pickup from Ezra since you reliably get 200 rep by water ritualing the mayor tree and the warden robot. With no other reason to get Ezra rep, this is just a helpful boost that can potentially get you that extra bump to get past reputation thresholds. Again, don’t get it with skill points, but always get it for rep.

### Trash Divining

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Pariahs (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

Another one you’ll probably only want to get through reputation rather than buy with skill points. As long as you’re crawling around the world and at least investigating points of interest when prompted, you usually have no shortage of secrets to share. You can learn some pretty obscure secrets and sometimes some pretty useful stuff, but it’s all RNG so you may just get nothing but 300 goatfolk villages. It’s pretty easy to get Pariah rep, especially because the Hindren Pariah at the Stilt can be water ritualed.

## Dual Wield

### Flurry/Offhand Strikes

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Hindren of Bey Lah - Eskhind (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

In order to be taught these skills, you need to ensure Eskhind becomes the Hindriarch which is not even a guarantee in every playthrough. If the stars align for you and you for some reason don’t have <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Flurry</span></span>/<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Offhand Strikes</span></span> yet, then it’s worth the rep.

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Flurry</span></span> makes a strike with every limb, which is a good placeholder until we can do this naturally every turn (which is the goal with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dual Wield</span></span> builds). <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Offhand Strikes</span></span> brings our offhand strike chance from 15% to 35%; a considerable increase but still not that great. While <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dual Wielding</span></span>, you should always have an offhand <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jab</span></span>; anything else and you’re missing out on DPS. One handy thing about <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Flurry</span></span> is that it does have an <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> prerequisite, meaning its cooldown can be nullified with <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/tripleJointed.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Triple-jointed</span></span>.

### Ambidexterity

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Vines (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Ambidexterity</span></span> brings us up to a 55% offhand strike chance. This brings our chance with a <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jab</span></span> up to 110%, meaning we reliably strike twice every turn. Combine this with elemental mods on each weapon and we already have a very powerful build. If you still are using a non-<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> in your offhand, stop immediately. Swap to a <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span>, it’s just miles better.

### Two-Weapon Fighting

If you’re lucky enough to find this being taught by a random village, this is the most expensive skill in the game to get and it confers all of its benefits even if you get it without any of its prerequisites so it’s very worth it. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Two-weapon Fighting</span></span> brings our offhand strike chance to 75%, or 150% with an offhand <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jab</span></span>. At this point, nothing else really compares; whatever skills you have your combat build is basically complete once you get this skill as long as you have <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jab</span></span>. Any other skills would just be icing on the cake; one of the most powerful skills out there.

## Endurance

### Shake It Off

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shake It Off</span></span> is not a skill you’ll notice particularly often in terms of the “shake off” effect. Only very powerful characters ever get to 30 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness">Toughness</span></span>, so your chances of shaking off the effect are almost always going to be under 20%. That’s still nothing to sneeze at and can definitely save you, but for most of the game you’re going to be looking at a much more modest 10-15% chance. The other effect of this skill is the more important one early and that is the 25% less poison damage and duration effect. This is often a very early skill I take since the sting of a Scorpiok cannot miss and can easily destroy a lower level character. This skill greatly increases your chance of survival after taking a sting.

### Swimming

**Faction:** Fish (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

Very, very few enemies have this skill, so not having it simply puts you on par with other enemies that happen to find themselves in deep liquid. You should just avoid deep liquid in general and most of the map doesn’t even have deep liquid to begin with; even less places have unavoidable deep liquid. I’ve always found other, more appealing options to take than this one, but if you have the Fish reputation this skill is just a straight upgrade whenever you find yourself in deep liquid so you might as well, especially because Fish reputation is great to have.

### Poison Tolerance

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

If you’re particularly worried about Slog and Scorpioks, then taking this skill is fine to do early. The issue with this skill is that it’s 100 skill points for a damage type that is just extremely rare and becomes even rarer post Golgotha. Something to note is that despite looking very similar, poison gas and corrosive gas are different with corrosive gas being more prevalent, more dangerous, and most importantly of all not poison. Take this skill if you’re still uncomfortable around Golgotha otherwise you can skip.

### Weathered

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Weathered</span></span> is a must-have skill as sources of fire and cold damage are everywhere and just taking 15% less damage from that is an easy win. With rank 16 <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/carapace.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Carapace</span></span>, you can actually be fully immune to cold and fire damage and swim around in lava for fun. This skill is single-handedly enough for you to have a comfortable amount of cold resistance for Bethesda Susa and can be made even better with many sources of cold or fire resistance early like albino ape gear for cold resistance or Issachari gear for fire resistance.

I’m admittedly biased here, but I’m not a huge user of tonics in general. Being able to ingest 2 has rarely ever been something I have wanted to do but if you play a style where everything revolves around constantly injecting tonics that you craft or something like that then I can see this being a little more useful. Some powerful combinations are skulk + hulk honey, hulk honey + salve, blaze + hulk honey, blaze + salve and salve + skulk. Get other skills first and maybe take another look at this one if you’re a menace for those tonics.

### Calloused

This is another must-have skill. Get this always right as soon as you have 23 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness">Toughness</span></span> as there’s literally no reason not to. 1 <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> with no <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> penalty just makes you take less damage on average from everything that hits you. This skill and <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Weathered</span></span> are the whole reason to go into the <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Endurance</span></span> tree.

### Longstrider

</div>

I usually find that I can <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> for longer than I need to with nothing boosting my <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> efficiency. There has never been a moment where I thought to myself “If only <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> didn’t run out so soon”. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> being on cooldown has certainly been an issue, but never it not lasting long enough. For 250 skill points we can get better skills that result in us not needing to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> at all, and certainly as the game goes on you will find yourself using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> less and less. By the time you even have the stats to get this, you probably won’t need it (even more so because if you have 25 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute toughness">Toughness</span></span>, you’re already beefy).

## First Aid

### Staunch Wounds

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Cult of the Coiled Lamb (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

You stop bleeding as long as you have a bandage and you’re not in combat. Bandages are common enough, but that second condition should make you blink a few times. That’s right, you cannot use this in combat which means for the cost of 100 skill points, you can have a skill that’s less useful than witchwood bark at doing what it is specifically designed to do. Chances are that if you’re out of combat and bleeding, you’re either fine and can just wait out the bleeding or you can just snack on some witchwood bark and heal through the bleed. If you could use this in combat, it’d be worth it. Even rep with the Cult of the Coiled Lamb is worth more than this mutation because you can get a few unlucky legendary kills and reduce your rep with them, which can make Stilt trips tricky if Tszappur squares up since you don’t want to kill him and remove an easy source of EXP from turning in Resheph secrets. As it stands now, just get <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Harvestry</span></span> or buy some witchwood bark at literally any apothecary.

It’s not too hard to get 5 turns of distance between yourself and an enemy and this skill can be pretty useful in getting rid of Quartziferous Mirrors since Mirror Bugs don’t tend to hurt you themselves so you can wade through a few and heal up with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Heal</span></span>. The only problem with this skill is that you have to get <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Staunch Wounds</span></span> first and because of this I tend not to get this skill.

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

If you are using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span>, this skill is an obvious take if you value your sanity. Actually, even if you are not using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span> or not using them often this is still a pretty decent take. This doesn’t just reduce their weight for equipped <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span>, but also for <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span> just sitting in your inventory. Not only will it reduce the weight of the weapon, but it will also reduce the weight of everything in the weapon as well (even the oil in flamethrowers). It’s 100 skill points to make <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span> more worth their weight in value so if you tend to pick up <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span> often or are tired of that backup flamethrower weighing you down, give this a pickup.

Again assuming you are actually using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span>, this is a great skill to have. Lower movement speed is perhaps the most crippling thing about <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span> and getting rid of that is fantastic. Not worth it if you are the <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Heavy Weapon</span></span> dabbler, but if you have one constantly equipped make sure to get this skill.

### Sweep

<div class="section-info">

</div>

It’s a steep cost for a skill that’s just not that great on the high-tier <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Heavy Weapons</span></span>. In fact, on the explosive ones it’s incredibly dangerous to use since you’ve got a decent chance to just blow yourself up. It requires you to expend ammo for each shot you make, so while you’re definitely putting ordinance downrange you’re probably better off just shooting normally and controlling where those shots end up; especially since most <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Heavy Weapon</span></span> shots come at a premium.

## Long Blade

### Long Blade Proficiency

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> are a class of weapon that has a considerable amount of complexity surrounding it. The secret to understanding these weapons is to understand the stances, which we start with two: <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Defensive Stance</span></span>. Switching between stances is free, we can do it as many times as we want meaning we may always attack with the stance we want. The tradeoff is that we also have to defend with the same stance as we attack with. Something key to understand is that <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> do not get the free +2 to hit like other weapons, so they particularly benefit from having good <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span>. Let’s break down each stance.

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Defensive Stance</span></span> should be the stance you primarily stay in; your de facto stance. This stance is what makes <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> easily the best weapon for non-melee combatants as you can have any <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Long Blade</span></span> equipped and benefit while other classes of weapons only benefit you while you’re actively attacking with them. This is also a powerful stance to increase your durability as having bonus <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> means you can invest more into <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> in the rare event that you do get hit if your build revolves primarily around <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span>.

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span> is a unique tradeoff, as against enemies with poor <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> you can deal more damage than other weapons with your attacks. Against enemies with good or decent <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> suffer quite a bit in comparison to other weapons and this issue is exacerbated even more against enemies like goatfolk with decent <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span>. Of course, in order for any of this to be useful, you have to have the game knowledge and understand what stats enemies have or use things like scanning to be able to read that information in-game. Stances apply to offhand <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> as well, and since <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> get a +1 to hit from skills, this stance can make <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dual Wielding</span></span> builds even more lethal as <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> have less penalty and with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dual Wield</span></span> skills can reap even more from the benefit.

Most of the time, you’ll end up using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Defensive Stance</span></span> as <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span> is quite situational and requires much more game knowledge to utilize in those proper situations.

### Lunge

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> is a costly skill and oftentimes I end up not taking it in order to hit other skills instead, but it’s got a low cooldown and some pretty decent effects that synergize with multiple play styles depending on the stance. Something to note is that with every <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> you will also attack and apply venom with a <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/stinger.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stinger</span></span> if you have one and hit with it.

While in <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> will move through a single tile between you and the enemy and make a strike at the enemy. This strike is at +2 penetration on top of your existing +1 penetration from <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span>. This makes this a very powerful opener if you land it. You can combine this with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> to get a second <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> in the middle of combat or to open yourself up to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> if you happen to find yourself suddenly in melee. Since this takes you through only 1 square, it tends to be less useful than <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> but is a handy alternative especially since you have extra penetration from <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span>.

While in <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Defensive Stance</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> will make an attack and then move you back 2 tiles. The enemy will of course likely just walk towards you on their next turn but this is a great skill in combination with ranged builds which makes <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> and sitting in <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Defensive Stance</span></span> even more appealing as you can back up for some free shots. This skill works particularly well with confusing or paralyzing venom and <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> as you can <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span>, apply your venom, and then <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> back in for a rapid series of attacks since the venom will prevent the enemy from moving closer. It also works in a similar way with high amounts of quickness as the enemy will be too slow to close the gap before you <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> back in.

While in <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dueling Stance</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> is guaranteed to hit and penetrate at least once, and in addition to all that will have a +1 penetration. This makes this particular version of <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> the one you’ll want to use if <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> comes off cooldown in the middle of combat or if you need to secure a kill or bypass heavy amounts of <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span>. In addition to that, since <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> has an <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> prerequisite our cooldown can be potentially nullified by <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/tripleJointed.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Triple-jointed</span></span> in which case we can use this repeatedly. We can also use this to get extra chances on applying our venom with <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/stinger.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stinger</span></span> since if the enemy resists the poison from our <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span>, we can then use Sting to try again.

### Dueling Stance

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dueling Stance</span></span> alone just gives the +2 to hit that most other weapons enjoy passively. While in isolation this isn’t that great and not worth the 200 skill points, it’s how <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dueling Stance</span></span> interacts with the activated <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Long Blade</span></span> skills (particularly <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Swipe</span></span>) that make it a worthwhile pickup. If you don’t have those skills, don’t get <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dueling Stance</span></span> but if you do have them, make sure not to skip this one.

In <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span>, you make an attack against everything in melee with you except allies, which means you attack all enemies and walls/furniture around you. Now, if you’re hitting more than 1 enemy with this you have more important problems to worry about than trying to hit them with a single attack. If you’re not hitting more than 1 enemy with this, it’s occasionally even worse than just bump attacking them since you have no chance of attacking with your offhand. Don’t use this with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span>.

In <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Defensive Stance</span></span>, you push all creatures in melee with you back 1 space and try to trip the enemies. This synergizes extremely well with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> in <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span> and can be used to give yourself some space for ranged attacks or for positioning adjustments. Another great defensive tool for ranged builds.

In <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dueling Stance</span></span>, you have the crown jewel of <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Long Blade</span></span> effects: a highly effective disarm. This rarely fails even against powerful enemies and for many creatures that use weapons, being disarmed can completely neuter them. Enemies will not try to pick up their disarmed weapon, and will instead just scratch at you with their fists or other natural weapons they may have. This is also extraordinarily effective against turrets as it not only renders them completely useless, it also gives you access to their weapon which is guaranteed to be jacked. This synergizes extraordinarily well with true kin with a biodynamic power plant or mutants with <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/electricalGeneration.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Electrical Generation</span></span>. It also allows you to get your weapon back if you use the Deploy Turrets <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span> skill, which can allow you to plant down strong ranged weapons and then get them back at the end of combat. In case all that wasn’t enough, turret weapons are incredibly expensive and a fantastic source of bits, so disassembling or selling the guns and cells can give massive amounts of wealth to quickly purchase stronger weapons and armor.

We get +1 <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> at the cost of -1 to hit, which by mid game or late game is very worth it with specifically vibro weapons; Improved <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span> goes nuts with vibro weapons which we’re fairly likely to have by the time we pick this skill up. Vibro weapons are the key to unlocking the full potential of <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> as a backup weapon to ranged builds or even as a main build with low <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>. They’re also one of the only ways of killing powerful endgame enemies with unbelievable amounts of <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span>, and the <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> bonus of <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Aggressive Stance</span></span> is added after the <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> of the vibro weapon is set to the enemies <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> meaning our <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> will always be 2 higher than the enemies’ <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span>.

The attribute prerequisites are pretty high, so you won’t even be capable of getting this until late. 10 rounds is quite a long time to be able to spam <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Swipe</span></span>, but there’s a small issue. You don’t really want to spam <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Swipe</span></span> unless you are for some reason fighting multiple enemies with weapons and need to disarm them all right now. That means that you’re left with just being able to really spam <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span>. Don’t get me wrong, 10 turns of <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> can be pretty good but 300 skill points for that is a pretty steep investment. If you didn’t get <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> or don’t plan on using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> for most of the game, then give this skill a pass. If you are an avid <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Lunge</span></span> user, then this is a great skill for you, especially if you have a <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/stinger.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stinger</span></span>.

## Persuasion

### Menacing Stare

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Flowers (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Sometimes

</div>

Let’s be clear here, is there never a reason to take this skill? No, this can be a perfectly usable skill and even be pretty clutch in some tight moments. The problem here is that it has a 17 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> prerequisite and has a chance to fail which means that unless you are building <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> specifically, you will be hard pressed to get much if any use out of this skill. While this is great news for Espers, for everyone else you’ll be better off with other skills. For Espers and anyone with the <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> to actually make use of this skill, you can use it to create distance between you and scary enemies as well as interrupt <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/sunderMind.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Sunder Mind</span></span> from a distance. If you have a ton of Flower reputation this can be a somewhat good pickup if you have the stats, but that’s not likely and you really want 250 Flower rep to make Tongue Tyrants neutral to you by endgame.

### Intimidate

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Fellowship of Wardens: Warden Indrix only (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

In the rare scenario you find yourself surrounded, this can be effective. But the melee range and the long cooldown make this a steep cost for 200 skill points, especially because only <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> builds can make use of it. Even then, if you’re an <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> build you probably don’t want to be anywhere near enemies and should have many other, better ways of getting away or keeping yourself away from enemies.

### Berate

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** Hermits (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

The great thing about this skill is it always works and has a pretty long duration, 6-36 rounds. It also has a decent range of 8 tiles and is a guaranteed way of breaking <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/sunderMind.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Sunder Mind</span></span>. It also won’t make the target try to kill you, so it naturally synergizes with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Proselytize</span></span> to get neutral creatures as followers (<span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/domination.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Domination</span></span> and Beguile will still anger the creature, so use at your own risk). The bad thing about this skill is that you have to get <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Menacing Stare</span></span> first, so it’s usually not worth it in total to take this skill because the cost is a bit higher than displayed. However, if you already have <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Menacing Stare</span></span> then this is actually a pretty good pickup. If you manage to find legendary Hermits, this is also a good pickup to get from them.

### Snake Oiler

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** Consortium of Phyta (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

This skill is incredible because it will essentially nullify the downside of a low <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> build of awful trade prices. The best part of this skill is that it is obtainable by reputation with the Consortium of Phyta, of which you can always find 2 legendary members for you to learn this skill from: Asphodel and the Oddly-Hued Glowpad. You can ritual both of them, ritual one and trade 2 secrets, or ritual one with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tactful</span></span> and trade 1 secret. Get this skill always, but don’t pay skill points for it since getting it through reputation is so reliable and so easy.

### Proselytize

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Mechanimists (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

This skill has a very hefty skill point cost, and since Mechanimist reputation is so easy to get, you shouldn’t really get this skill through skill points. If you like followers, then this is a must-have skill. Indeed, followers can be quite powerful and in particular this is the only way to get a Soupy Sludge as your follower which can be unbelievably deadly if fed liquids. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Proselytize</span></span> won’t get you just any follower though, you essentially have to both get past their mental armor and be a higher level than them or else you won’t succeed, so those with low <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> will struggle in Proselytizing anything but the very weakest in mental armor. On the bright side, you can try this as many times as you want and you will never upset an ally, unlike <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/beguiling.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Beguiling</span></span>.

### Inspiring Presence

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 250

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Your followers get a miniscule amount of <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/HP.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">HP</span></span> (4 \* <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> mod). Even if you stack <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span> and have an insane mod, it’ll probably only be around 12 which works out to 48 <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/HP.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">HP</span></span> for insane end-tier god <span class="injected"><span class="attribute ego">Ego</span></span>. Anything less and this just gives even worse <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/HP.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">HP</span></span>. If you have literally nothing else to get and you have tons of followers, then sure why not. But there are better things to get.

## Pistol

### Steady Hand

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Extra accuracy, which works out to be quite important on <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> because of their inferior accuracy in comparison to rifles. If you’re using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>, gotta start here.

### Akimbo

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** Mysterious Strangers (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

I’ll be honest, the only legendary Mysterious Stranger I’ve ever found is a legendary Star Kraken so I put not worth it for the rep just because by the time you find that you should long have <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Akimbo</span></span>. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Akimbo</span></span> doesn’t just shoot both of your <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> whenever you shoot, it shoots all of your guns whenever you shoot. That’s right, if you happen to have more than just 1 gun of any kind, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Akimbo</span></span> will fire all of them every time you shoot. This means if you have Gun Rack or Giant Hands or have magnetized guns, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Akimbo</span></span> will shoot all those suckers at once making it a worthwhile pickup even if you’re not using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>. It’s just a straight up DPS increase, very worth it.

### Weak Spotter

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Higher crit chance for 150 skill points? This is an obvious pick, great skill for <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Pistol</span></span> users, not much else to say.

### Sling and Run

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

I mean you’re probably not using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> much and if you are, you’re probably not firing your <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>. But, it’s 50 skill points so if you’ve got tastier skills and don’t have much to buy then why not; it’s cheap enough that in the niche use case you’ll use it, it’ll come in handy.

### Disarming Shot

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

The disarm here isn’t as reliable as the disarm from <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span>, but with high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> and many shots you can disarm pretty often. The only difference here is that you’ll kill your target more often before you disarm them with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>, but that’s rarely a problem except for the case of turrets where you want their weapons. It’s passive and can easily save you, and if you combine this with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Akimbo</span></span> chain <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>, you’ll actually very reliably disarm enemies. Fantastic skill.

### Dead Shot

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

We already have a skill to increase our crit hit chance, and now we can double the <span class="injected"><span class="stat pv">PV</span></span> bonus from critting? No brainer; a straight upgrade that benefits even more from the masterwork mod.

### Empty the Clips

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

If you’re heavily relying on your <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> in order to deal damage, this is an incredible skill to get. For 20 turns, you essentially double your DPS and this is more pronounced on energy weapons since you never have to reload and gets even better with enhanced quickness. You’ll need to stay still to get the full benefit, but enemies will just melt from your damage here. If you aren’t heavily invested in <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> and only use them as a backup, you may want to skip this one since the skill point cost is quite high.

### Fastest Gun in the Rust

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 400

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

The cost of this one is steep, and I mean steep. This is the most expensive skill in the game and it has a 29 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> prerequisite. If you can afford it though, this is a fantastic skill to take as it just gives you a permanent increase of DPS by 25%. Again, if <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span> are more of a seldom used backup, then it may not be worth taking. If you do use <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Pistols</span></span>, this is your crown jewel.

## Self-Discipline

### Meditate

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** Seekers of the Sightless Way (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This one is unusual because it’s not that it does something that is particularly useful or game-changing, it just preserves my sanity. I always take this as soon as I get a good amount of <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/HP.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">HP</span></span> (150+ or so) just because regenerating from combat takes drastically less time with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Meditate</span></span>. It’s passive so your character will just automatically <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Meditate</span></span> while resting. If you haven’t tried this skill, try it. Resting feels so much better with it. If you somehow have the rep to get this, then pick it up; it doesn't hurt.

### Fasting Way

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

It’s 50 skill points, why not? You’ll use less water and your metabolizing effects will last longer. Don’t take it before you get your build up and running, but otherwise it’s convenient. If you use the Amphibious defect, then this is a good offset to that as well.

### Lionheart

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Never

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Basically the only thing that will ever actually fear you are dreadroot. Unless you are worried about plants that never move and die in 1 hit to literally anything, don’t take this.

### Iron Mind

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Robots (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

Very few things in the game confuse you, so unless you are an <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span> with high amounts of glimmer this will rarely be used. The Seekers that use this are very rarely found anyways, so essentially your only real source of <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/confusion.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Confusion</span></span> are Enigma Snails and <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/esper.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Esper</span></span> hunters. The chance to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shake It Off</span></span> isn’t great either, so unless you’ve got points burning a hole in your inventory there’s no point in this one.

### Conatus

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

If you’re really interested in increasing your <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> duration, this is the one to take over <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Longstrider</span></span>. However, for the same reasons as <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Longstrider</span></span> isn’t worth it, this is also not worth it.

### Mind Over Body

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Fasting Way</span></span> is already enough in case you’re being bothered by eating often, this takes that to the extreme. Again if you’ve got nothing to spend points on, this can be convenient but 150 skill points is not negligible and you can definitely get better skills for that cost.

## Shield

### Block

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Fellowship of Wardens: Wardens Esther or Warden Une only (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Again, like all equipment skills I am rating these assuming you are playing a build that utilizes them. Let’s take this time to explain <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> mechanics, since they are not simple or obvious.

Baseline, you have a 25% chance to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Block</span></span> an attack if you are wielding a <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> in any hand. An equipped <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> will constantly apply the <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> penalty (if it has one), but only apply its <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> benefit on a successful <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Block</span></span>. If you have multiple <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shields</span></span> equipped, the <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> penalty will apply for each <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span>. When a creature makes an attack on its turn, the chance to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Block</span></span> is rolled once. If the <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Block</span></span> was successful, you gain an <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> bonus for that attack only equal to the highest <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> bonus of all your equipped <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shields</span></span>. That <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> can then no longer <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Block</span></span> any other attack that creature makes this turn. If the <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Block</span></span> was unsuccessful, then you gain no <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> benefit for that attack. This process repeats for every subsequent attack made by that creature on this turn.

This means that since enemies rarely attack more than once per turn, wearing multiple <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shields</span></span> is not worth it. Now that we know <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> mechanics, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Block</span></span> increases our <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Block</span></span> chance to 50%; not much more to say just makes your <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shields</span></span> more effective.

### Shield Slam

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This skill is very powerful, and especially so if you have high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> and a powerful <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span>. The attack can be resisted in which case it doesn’t do anything, but if it’s not resisted then it will do guaranteed damage that bypasses <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> and will knock the enemy prone which will mean their counterattack is negated for that turn since they’ll have to spend it standing up. With decent <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>, this attack will rarely be resisted so you have a very reliable attack in <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Slam</span></span>. Not only do you get the activated attack, but you will also always <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> when <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charging</span></span> which makes your engagements even more deadly. You can also improve your <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> damage by modding your <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> to be spiked.

### Swift Blocking

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Since we’ve already established that enemies will rarely attack more than once, there’s no rush to pick this skill up, especially at the cost. However, just because enemies rarely attack more than once doesn’t mean they never attack more than once, so this is still a very worthwhile pickup since it’ll give you the benefit of wielding multiple <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shields</span></span> without actually having to wield multiple <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shields</span></span>.

### Deft Blocking

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

We now have a 75% chance to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Block</span></span>, this is an easy take. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> can’t benefit you if it doesn’t <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Block</span></span> so we want to boost this at every opportunity.

### Staggering Block

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

This skill is by no means reliable in any way. With very high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span>, it can become somewhat common but will never be anything but a little sugar on top. A stun for 1-2 rounds is a little low for how uncommon it is to get the stun since you not only have to roll the % chance, but you also have to have blocked the attack in the first place which we can have a maximum 75% chance to do (without relics). Can this skill save you? Absolutely. But there’s certainly better, more reliable ways to save yourself or get advantages for the cost.

### Shield Wall

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield Wall</span></span> is like other stance skills, it has zero activation cost. Unlike other stance skills, it has much more attainable costs and the benefits are equally huge. Unfortunately, it does only last 3 turns which isn’t much, but can be the difference between life and death if you get yourself caught with enemies on all sides since it literally does <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Block</span></span> every attack for those 3 turns, regardless of your other <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span> skills and regardless of just how many attacks are made against you. You could have 9 Oboroquoru using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Flurry</span></span> for a total of 54 attacks in one turn, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield Wall</span></span> will <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Block</span></span> them all. Note that blocking means that you get the benefit of your <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shield</span></span>; which for the non-bucklers that you can use this with means you get a significant increase but doesn’t make you invincible.

The real thing that puts this stance over others despite its short duration is that it also has a fairly short cooldown as well; meaning that at high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower">Willpower</span></span> you can essentially just spam this for massive <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> benefit. While high <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span> won’t make you invincible to everything, it will make you exceptionally difficult to kill for the vast majority of creatures.

## Short Blades

### Short Blade Expertise

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

The +1 to hit is marginal here, but because it makes our main hand <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> attacks be 25% faster, this actually starts to make <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> look attractive to high quickness builds. Typically though, the real reason to use <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> is for offhand attacks with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jab</span></span>. Dual <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> builds are essentially mandatory if you’re planning on using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> in your main hand just because <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> have very few effects that require being wielding in your primary hand to be effective, so why not equip a more powerful weapon and get its benefits as well? Aside from this skill, if you’re going for offhand <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span>, you’ll really just want <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jab</span></span> and maybe <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Bloodletter</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Rejoinder</span></span>.

### Jab

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

It is solely because of this skill that <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> are just the best weapon to use in your offhand. It will double your chance to hit with your offhand, and that chance does not cap at 100%; meaning you can very realistically boost your offhand strike chance with a <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> to 150% with maxed <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dual Wield</span></span> skills and <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jab</span></span>. If you never use <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> in your offhand, then of course you don’t need this skill but if you’re using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> at all, you should have one in your offhand.

### Bloodletter

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This makes your <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> attacks do just a bit more damage. It eventually synergizes well with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shank</span></span>, so it will become important for full <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> builds. Free damage is always nice though, and while <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Bloodletter</span></span> doesn’t give you that significant of an increase, you can stack this quite quickly with multiple <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> and high offhand attack chance.

### Hobble

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

A hobbled enemy is quite easy to get away from and this will give you a guaranteed penetration on hit. The problem with this skill is you can only use it with a <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span> in your primary hand, which most builds that use <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> will use it as an offhand. If you happen to use <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span> in your main hand, then this is a good skill. If you don’t, then you can give this an easy pass.

I’m giving this a really big caveat: If you specifically are stacking <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/tripleJointed.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Triple-jointed</span></span> and are using main hand <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blades</span></span>, then you can actually do some pretty nasty damage for free if you get lucky with your procs since <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> has an <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> prerequisite. If you don’t, then in order to get any use out of this skill you have to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> into the enemy which you usually specifically don’t want to do unless you’ve found yourself way out of position and an enemy is blocking you. There are many common scenarios where you really, really do not want to swap places with the enemy because it will just be way worse for you. Using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> offensively also means that you cannot use it defensively for the duration of its cooldown, which can be risky. All in all, there are definitely some silly builds where you can stack this a crazy amount but usually this is not worth it.

If you have high <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span>, then this is just a no-brainer take as it’ll give you a straight upgrade to your DPS. This can be used regardless of how many times you’re attacked at once, so the increase can be quite significant and potentially even allow you to kill weaker support enemies while you focus on a bigger threat. If you have terrible <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> then this won’t do anything for you, but otherwise is a great addition.

While this seems like just free damage from an activated ability, in <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Dual Wield</span></span> builds this is typically not worth it since you only get a single attack instead of your multiple attacks from your multiple equipped weapons. If you can get multiple bleeds stacked on your target, this can potentially hit for massive damage. While you probably won’t be using this to punch through crazy <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/AV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">AV</span></span>, it can be used to nuke high <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/HP.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">HP</span></span> targets especially if you have ways of applying status effects outside of bleed and have a powerful <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Short Blade</span></span>. <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/tripleJointed.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Triple-jointed</span></span> builds can also make use of the <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> prerequisite to potentially spam this attack.

You’ll probably not see the value in this very often, but it’s common enough to want to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> to either close the gap on a ranged enemy or to escape from a ranged enemy so having a better chance of dodging those attacks is quite useful. This is especially useful early on in combating slugsnouts since you’ll absolutely want to get away or close the gap on them as fast as possible because of their high damage. Aside from these, you’ll have to get this one in order to get better skills in the tree so this is an easy early take.

If you happen to not have <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Sprint</span></span> (like if you permanently Dominate a creature), you can gain that ability when you buy this skill.

### Deft Throwing

**Cost:** 50

**Worth:** No

</div>

Most of my runs will just ignore this one since I don’t throw things very often in general. That’s not to say this is a bad skill because for what it does it’s actually quite good. It’s just that throwing things and more so being accurate with what you throw is rarely that important. If your playstyle revolves heavily on crafting and throwing grenades, then by all means take this skill, you’ll see great return. Otherwise, it’s just not necessary.

### Charge

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This is my favorite skill in the game, and arguably also the best skill in the game. It has so many applications and so many synergies that it’s really hard to overvalue it. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> actually has quite a few mechanics around it, so let’s first cover what it does.

When you use <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>, you need to select a target 2-3 tiles away from you. Any target within 1 tile is too close. After selecting your target, you’ll make an attack on the first wall or creature you hit on the way to that target. You’ll then make an attack and if you hit, your attack has +1 penetration on it. If you are in melee with a hostile enemy, you will be unable to use <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>.

The first thing to add to the mix is what constitutes a target. A target can be anything that isn’t an empty tile, which means you can even target items on the floor. You won’t attack items on the floor, so in these cases you will actually <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> beyond your target and get Stunned for one turn. You can use this fact as well as the fact that you can <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> walls to use <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> as an escape tool as well as an initiation tool. While using <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> in this way has more requirements, it gets you farther than anything else in a single turn.

The second thing to add to the mix is that <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Axes</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Cudgels</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Shields</span></span> have a dedicated skill that just improves your <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> strikes. Those were covered already in their own sections.

The third thing to add is that if you have a <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/stinger.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Stinger</span></span> or <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/horns.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Horns</span></span>, you will automatically make strikes with them when you <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>. This means that with these mutations you can make your initiations that much more powerful to potentially kill or disable an enemy on the <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> itself.

The fourth thing to add is that you can improve your range significantly whether you’re a true kin or a mutant. Mutants can get a level based increase with <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/wings.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Wings</span></span> and true kin can use the pentaceps cybernetic. This means that both your escape and initiation range increase significantly.

The fifth thing to add is that <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> synergizes naturally with many other skills like <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jump</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span>, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Swipe</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Slam</span></span> as they all move yourself or the enemy which allow you to get another <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> in the middle of an extended combat. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> has a low cooldown which with middling levels of <span class="injected"><span class="attribute willpower">Willpower</span></span> can easily allow it to come off cooldown in the middle of many mid-late game fights.

All in all, there’s no reason to not get <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span> in any run; even runs that you don’t fight in melee because of its escape potential.

### Juke

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> moves you in any tile you want (except for walls) for literally no opportunity cost. It doesn’t just move you fast, it moves you instantly; regardless of quickness you move in that tile right away and can act again. This makes <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> the perfect defensive tool especially when combined with skills like <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> and <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Charge</span></span>. There are many scenarios where the difference between a great position and a compromised position is a single tile and situations where an enemy cuts off your escape route.

In addition to being a great tool for the purposes of moving that one tricky tile, it also will break the hold enemies can have on you since you can use <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> even in these scenarios. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> also has an <span class="injected"><span class="attribute agility">Agility</span></span> prerequisite which makes it a prime candidate for <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/tripleJointed.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Triple-jointed</span></span>. Finally, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Juke</span></span> is also a prerequisite for <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tumble</span></span> which gives us access to +1 <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/statImages/DV.png" /></span></span><span class="injected"><span class="stat">DV</span></span> permanently, so it’s worth taking even if it wasn’t already great.

## Tinkering

### Gadget Inspector

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Barathrumites (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Gadget Inspector</span></span> will improve your ability to identify artifacts, which is pretty handy. With it, you will quite rarely fail at inspecting artifacts even with low <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span> and even on high complexity artifacts. Even more rarely will you break artifacts you try to identify. Deploying wiring is, as of now, rather useless but this skill does give one ability not explicitly mentioned.

There are several ways to learn artifact recipes that don’t involve data disks. The most well-known is <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/psychometry.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Psychometry</span></span> which anyone can get from cooking with bananas, but you can also learn recipes from Barathrumites and Daughters of Exile you can water ritual. In either of these circumstances, you need <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Gadget Inspector</span></span> in order to actually craft these recipes. Of course, you’ll also need bits so <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Disassemble</span></span> is also a must-have, but you don’t actually need any of the Tinker X skills to craft artifacts. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Gadget Inspector</span></span> will also allow you to see what recipes are on data disks so you can begin your collection for when you get Tinker X skills.

In my experience, you should always save the skill points here and get this skill for reputation from the Barathrumites. Barathrumite rep is absurdly easy to get as you do tons of quests for them and you won’t need the benefit from this skill until about the point you can get the skill for rep from the Barathrumites.

### Disassemble

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This is your only way of getting bits, so if you’re planning on doing literally any <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span> you must have this skill. There’s not much more analysis required for this one because of its necessity.

### Scavenger

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

If you’re planning on doing insane amounts of <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span> right from the start, then this skill can see some use. However, the problem is that you don’t get that many useful bits from this in the short term. Typically, there will be no shortage of artifacts that aren’t of much use or are duplicates that you can <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Disassemble</span></span> for all the bits you really need. Again, unless you’re doing some insane levels of <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tinkering</span></span> like throwing grenades for literally every enemy you find, you’ll probably run into no shortage of bits. You can find some other useful stuff in the trash besides just scrap, but you’ll probably be better off putting your skill points elsewhere.

### Lay Mine/Set Bomb

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

You’ll rarely find situations where you can actually use this skill well as places you’ve already been probably won’t have any enemies in them and if you can get around a mine, the enemies can also probably get around the mine. You can combine this skill with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Jump</span></span> for decent effect, but it always seems to be the case that it takes far more effort than is worth it in order for this skill to actually be effective in the way you’d expect.

While mines are mostly useless, bombs are more useful since these work on a timer; meaning that if you can plan well enough you can get your enemy in the range and not catch yourself in it as well. Again, this does take more effort than is usually worth it and so suffers from the same problem as mines. You’re just going to be better off tossing the grenades right on their head. The only situation where that’s not viable is with Cherubim so in that particular niche you can see a bit more use out of bombs specifically.

### Repair

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Daughters of Exile (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

Another skill that while definitely has its uses is far better off being purchased for rep instead of skill points. Keep the skill points for combat effectiveness and such, by the time you need this skill you can buy it from Yla Haj in Ezra. This skill will <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Repair</span></span> both broken and rusted items, so it’s definitely worth the pickup at some point just in case.

### Deploy Turret

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Sometimes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Deploy Turret</span></span> is an interesting skill because it has a lot of potential, but needs a considerable amount of setup and support. If you have high <span class="injected"><span class="attribute strength">Strength</span></span> (to carry weapons/ammo/cells) and the <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Long Blades</span></span> disarm (to get those guns back), this can be quite strong with the right setup. The downside is it leads to an (in my opinion) very boring playstyle where you secure a location, set up your killbox and then lure in enemies to be obliterated by your turrets. You can also use flamethrower/freeze ray turrets in order to disable your opponents. If you don’t mind playing extremely slow and have the right setup for this skill, it can be pretty good. If you’re not planning on playing around this skill, then you probably will find little to no use from it.

### Tinker I

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span> is conveniently for us the best of the 3 Tinker X skills. With it, we get access to learn recipes through data disks and with it the majority of tinkerable items. Mind you, most of those items aren’t that great but <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span> really isn’t about the artifacts, it’s about the mods. The vast majority of useful mods can be found in <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span> and since the cost to get this is so cheap and the power of mods you can get so high, <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span> is always useful no matter what build or style you’re playing.

### Tinker II

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

<span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tinker II</span></span> is very notable for the powerful artifacts you’re able to craft with it. In particular, the geomagnetic disc, portable wall and high powered magnet are all very useful items to be able to build, and while the mods aren’t quite as spectacular as those in <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span>, with certain builds mods like jacked and overloaded are great and radio-powered is always a fantastic mod to get. In particular, I really want to have this skill by A Call To Arms in order to build the portable walls that I need. While this skill doesn’t have quite the magnitude of <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tinker I</span></span>, the prerequisites are low enough and the benefits high enough that this is an easy pickup.

### Reverse Engineer

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Here’s the problem: if you find one artifact to <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Disassemble</span></span>, that’s probably the one version of the artifact that you need. There are some artifacts that you may be interested in creating multiples of (like guns), but generally these will be things like grenades and salves which you can learn how to build through <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/psychometry.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Psychometry</span></span> from cooking bananas. What you can’t build through <span class="injected"><span><img class="inline-icon" src="/1/asset/s/latest/public/assets/images/mutationImages/psychometry.png" /></span><span class="mutation">Psychometry</span></span> will tend to be so rare that you really don’t want to risk the 75% chance of failure because then you have nothing. Chances are solid that by the time you learn the recipe, you’ll have all the copies of the artifact you could want had you not disassembled them. And then add on top of that the 25 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span> prerequisite and you get a skill that just is not worth the cost.

### Tinker III

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Don’t get me wrong, you can build some pretty insane gear with <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Tinker III</span></span> and assuming you just have it somewhat early from something like a random village, you can get some powerful artifacts (assuming you have a way of buying the right scrap for bits). Unfortunately, there is a substantial cost besides the 300 skill points which is the 29 <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span> prerequisite. Since <span class="injected"><span class="attribute intelligence">Intelligence</span></span> has an awful return on investment (at some point, you just have all the skills you need), investing the points all the way up to 29 to build these artifacts only slightly earlier than you could otherwise get them (since you still need the bits) just ends up not being worth it.

## Wayfaring

### Mind’s Compass/Make Camp

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

The obvious use of this skill is to save your sanity by making overworld travel not completely awful, but this is actually highly beneficial to your survival as you won’t get lost as often in dangerous areas. While getting lost isn’t an immediate death sentence, depending on your abilities, how dangerous the area is you got lost in and the look of the map you got lost in, you can be pretty dead pretty quickly with the wrong luck. This is especially true early game, so this is a must-have as soon as you start looking to leave for Grit Gate. <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Make Camp</span></span> comes standard on all characters, but if you happen to permanently Dominate a creature you won’t have this. In this scenario, getting the first <span class="injected"><span class="skill">Wayfaring</span></span> skill becomes even more important since not being able to ease your hunger whenever you want becomes seriously annoying (believe me).

### Wilderness Lore

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 25 (Flower Fields Lore), 50

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Roots (Jungle Lore) (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

These are all really cheap skills to grab and almost every single one of them is worth it. The only exceptions are Flower Field lore, Ruins lore and Salt Dune lore. These are either too easy to walk around, not dangerous, and/or don’t contain interesting locations. Jungle lore is especially good to grab just for the sheer amount of Jungle tiles on the map. The rest of the lore is super handy to find lairs in order to improve your reputation with factions like Unshelled Reptiles, Fish and Flowers as well as finding lairs with high concentrations of legendary creatures like Baboon and Goatfolk lairs. Make sure your combat build is online before grabbing these, but once you’ve got your core these are very nice to go into.
