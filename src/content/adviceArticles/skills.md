# Skills

---

Skills are the unsung hero of Caves of Qud. In fact, I’d argue that your skills are more important than both your gear and your mutations/cybernetics. While not as obviously powerful as exploding some dude’s head with your mind, skills shape your run in the more subtle, less appreciated ways that are nonetheless extremely important. Here, I’ll be covering all the skills in the game and analyzing when I would want to have that skill: Early Game (levels 1-20), Mid Game (levels 20-30), or Late Game (levels 30+). For weapon skills, I will be assuming that this weapon plays into your primary weapon build. I will also cover factions that teach the skill and if it’s worth it to learn it that way or learn it with skill points if applicable. Finally, if I think the skill is not worth the skill points I will make mention of that.

## Acrobatics

### Swift Reflexes

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 75

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Cats (Not Worth)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Swift Reflexes is one of those must-have skills and is the intro skill to the Acrobatics tree. +5 to your DV against ranged weapons is incredibly useful to have and while it won’t save you if you just dump DV, this skill makes it so you can perfectly avoid all projectiles at 25 DV or more, which is a reliable DV to have by end game. Of course, it’s useful before that since we’re bound to be shot quite a bit on our journey to the end game, so avoiding those projectiles means you’ll get there more often.

### Spry

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Free +2 DV, this is an incredible skill. Take this always, literally always.

### Jump

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Frogs, Svardym (Frogs Not Worth, Svardym Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Legendary Frogs are actually not so easy to find while legendary Svardym lairs are decently common and you’ll probably want Svardym rep anyways so if you don’t have Jump by then, it’s worth the pickup. Jump moves you two squares in a single turn, but you can’t Jump over any creatures so while it’s an inferior engage tool to Charge, Jump is more defensive in nature or can give you that extra bump to be able to Charge in. Jump is functionally similar to Juke, just not quite as good and with a longer cooldown. The primary reason to use Jump therefore is to extend your gap between an enemy or to cross hazardous pools of liquid and pits.

This skill also synergizes with Wings as they greatly increase the distance you can Jump with mutation level, and if you for some reason want to Jump further as a true-kin you can install Pneumatic Pistons.

### Tumble

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This skill just buffs Juke and gives 1 DV, and we’re really taking this for the DV. Every free point of DV you get is points you can put to AV instead and make yourself as durable as possible. You want Juke anyway since it’s a good skill, so getting to reduce its cooldown and give that DV is just more incentive to get Juke.

## Axes

### Axe Proficiency

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

A permanent +2 to hit is quite good actually, and is one of the more noticeable weaknesses of Long Blades. This allows you to focus mainly on Strength for your build and still have a reliable chance to hit (as long as you don’t dump Agility). Being the base skill for Axes, you’re gonna have to get this one if you plan on using them seriously.

### Charging Strike

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Charge is arguably the best melee skill in the game and skills that synergize directly with it like this are part of the reason why. Double the chance to Dismember and our Cleaves are more deadly if they land. Passive benefit that you’ll get a lot of mileage out of.

### Cleave

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This skill really incentivises you to use as many hands as possible with Axes and pump your Strength up as high as you can as you can very quickly shred apart the armor of enemies. Even early game, cleaving off even just 1 or 2 AV can result in more penetrations and deceptively higher damage. While this skill is not enough for you to rip apart the very highest armored enemies in the game, against anything less you’ll shred them to pieces quite fast.

### Dismember

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Cleave a few times then hit Dismember to permanently cripple your enemy. If you chop off their main limb, you may just win the fight outright. Added chance to just do this on normal attacks as well and you can find yourself able to fight and kill enemies beyond what your stats would normally suggest. It’s random what limb you chop off so success is likely but not exactly reliable which is the one real drawback of this skill; don’t rely on it to save you.

### Hook and Drag

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No (Sometimes)

</div>

Hook and Drag is pretty underrated; but it is one skill I’m willing to sacrifice if I need the skill points elsewhere. You essentially have up to 9 rounds of guaranteed hits on an enemy, which can be very powerful on enemies that have high DV. If you have decent Agility, then this becomes redundant since you just hit all the time anyways so then it’s really just used to attack an enemy as you bring them somewhere which isn’t usually any functionally different than just moving there and then picking up combat where you left off.

This changes when you have significantly enhanced movement speed, as now Hook and Drag lets you attack as fast as you can move which synergizes very well with Multiple Legs. So unless you have Multiple Legs or very poor Agility, you can probably give this a miss for your build.

### Decapitate

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

A low chance to just win the fight immediately (on most enemies). It’s not reliable mind you, but happens often enough to be very nice. A surprising number of things need a head, so don’t sleep on trying to Dismember everything you fight; it may be far more effective than you think.

### Berserk!

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

By the time you get this, you should have a powerful enough build already where this skill is nice but not exactly required. Because of this and the massive skill point investment, I’ll often avoid taking this until I don’t have any other helpful skills to take anymore. Make no mistake though, is extremely powerful and can nearly guarantee your victory against a single enemy.

The duration on it is very bad, but 5 rounds is really all you need for most enemies. Even if they survive, unless none of your attacks penetrate they will be so crippled the fight should just be over. Just don’t expect this skill to give you the win against every enemy in the game.

## Bow and Rifle

### Draw a Bead/Steady Hands

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

You get both of these at the same time, so I’ll analyze them together. Steady Hands just makes you more accurate, which if you’re using Bows/Rifles then you’re gonna want that. Draw a Bead makes you even more accurate by spending a turn. If you’ve got a lot of space between you and your target, this is good and especially useful earlier in the game. Once you get highly accurate guns and high Agility you’ll stop using Draw a Bead for the accuracy and instead use it in conjunction with other Bow and Rifle skills. As the intro skills, these are super useful to anyone using these weapons.

### Suppressive Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

By spamming this you can lock an enemy down indefinitely. The shot does have to penetrate which means enemies with high AV will be able to shrug it off, but for all others this just gives you a practically free win against a melee enemy. It’s very good, if only all the other Bow and Rifle skills were similar this would actually be a cool tree worthy of investment.

### Sure Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

You lose your mark to fire 1 (one!) shot that is guaranteed to hit. Most rifles have fairly high accuracy anyways so any rifle worth using better than a Carbine is getting virtually no benefit from this anyways since it wasn’t going to miss with the boost from both Draw a Bead and Steady Hands. It’s not like 150 skill points is a trivial cost either, this is quite expensive. Get something better.

### Wounding Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

You cause a bleed for each penetration you do and lose your mark. You’re probably only penetrating 3-5 times max, so that’s a 3-5 damage bleed that the enemy can save from for the cost of your mark. This is pathetic, the cost is too high for too small a benefit.

### Disorienting Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Even if the effect from this skill was worth the cost (200 skill points with 250 skill points of skill prerequisites), you only get this benefit if the target cannot see or hear any allies; so virtually never unless this is the last enemy. What do we get for this? -4 DV and MA. Most enemies aren’t that hard to hit so the DV is pretty useless and unless you’re using lots of mental attacks against the last enemy, the MA is also pretty useless. Not worth the investment.

### Beacon Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

You need to ignite your enemy for this to work, which can be done if you’re willing to liberally use Thermal Grenades but all you get from this is your shot critting. If you spend the turns you would need to mark the target and throw the grenade, you’d be doing more damage than if you use this skill. If your target is so ignited that it’s locked in place, who cares about a crit it’s probably dead soon anyways.

### Flattening Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

The effect of this is insanely good, in fact it’s one of the best skill effects in the game. It not only locks them in place, but also knocks them prone and disarms them. So why is it not worth it? Well, in order to gain this benefit the enemy must have 6 walls surrounding them. In case you can’t visualize what that means, it means they must be in a 1 tile wide corridor in order for this to work. If you want to meticulously construct corridors for yourself and lure enemies in there to use this skill, go ahead. Otherwise, most of the time you won’t even be able to use this.

### Ultra Fire

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

If there was more than 1 fire ability that was worth it, this would be an insane skill. Unfortunately, they’re all trash so you should give this a miss as well.

## Cooking and Gathering

### Meal Preparation

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Villagers of Kyakukya (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Being able to gain cooking effects is run changing and very important for any successful run. Cooking is not my preferred way to play as managing ingredients and rerolling when I get an effect I don’t want is annoying and tedious for me, so instead I usually just use ingredients that have 1 or 2 effects in order for me to more reliably get the one I want. So unless I’m using an ingredient like Spine Jam or Phase Silk I usually just go for jerky for HP effects.

This is an admittedly simplistic approach to cooking and you can get some very strong effects, but I won’t pretend to have extensive knowledge over that. Even if you just follow my approach of spamming HP increase cooking effects, this is still a very good skill you should have in every run.

### Harvestry

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Villagers of Joppa (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

If you’re planning on doing a lot of cooking, Harvestry is going to be one of your primary ways of getting good ingredients. Even if you’re not planning on doing much cooking, Harvestry is still useful in getting monetarily valuable ingredients and the coveted Yondercane for an escape tool. In the very early game it’s also quite good for getting you some extra Witchwood Bark in case you get put in one too many dangerous scenarios.

### Butchery

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Cannibals (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Butchery is the second main way of getting your ingredients. Not only can you get valuable ingredients from Butchering corpses, the ingredients you get here are typically much more expensive than ones you get from Harvestry at the cost of being heavier. Further still, you can butcher certain types of corpses for valuable items (ogre apes, kaleidoslugs, quartz baboons, etc). Don’t bother wasting time grinding Cannibal rep for this, just spend the 50 skill points. Be careful with this if you don’t have Meal Preparation, since many Butchered ingredients can be quite heavy when unprocessed.

### Spicer

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Denizens of Yd Freehold (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Since I don’t really use many cooking effects in general, I’ve got even less experience combining 3 or more ingredients for the effects. But you can get this for rep from Yd Freehold and there’s nothing else to do for that faction rep so might as well.

### Carbide Chef

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Using this, you’re actually able to control what cooking effects you get. If you can get a good amount of ingredients, and especially if you combine this with Spicer, you can get some very powerful cooking effects with perfect reliability. If you’re planning on sophisticated cooking, this is a very useful skill to have.

## Cudgel

### Cudgel Proficiency

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

+2 to hit is pretty big, just like it is for Axes. Being the intro skill for Cudgels, if you’re interested in seriously using Cudgels at all then this is a must-have.

### Bludgeon

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This skill is the single thing that makes Cudgels good. Daze and Stun are both some of the best and most reliable debuffs to put on an enemy, and having a 50% chance at that is pretty huge. Combine this with Double-muscled and not only do you have the synergy from the extra Strength, but you also get an even better chance to Daze and Stun. It’s not uncommon for many Cudgel builds to be capable of permanently or nearly permanently stunning all enemies, which is good because Cudgel damage is pretty awful.

### Charging Strike

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Start off the fight with a free daze? Potentially even a stun? Incredible, very good skill. Charge remains a critical part of every melee build, super worth it.

### Conk

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Apes (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

It’s an activated skill, but the cooldown is incredibly short and gives you a free daze or stun. If they’re already stunned, you can actually just put them out of commission for the whole fight in case you’re being attacked by multiple enemies. As long as you don’t attack them, they’ll stay down for an incredibly long time giving you plenty of room to clear out any other attackers.

### Backswing

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Not only does this just flat out increase your DPS by 25%, but it also gives you more chances to daze and stun since you’re attacking more times with a Cudgel. Great skill to have, seriously improves your fighting abilities.

### Slam

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This is the first Cudgel skill that I will often skip out on. It’s not that it’s a bad skill, it’s just not quite as good as the rest. The problem with Slam is that it pushes away your opponent which is usually not what you want to do. If you don’t engage with Charge, then you can follow up a Slam with a Charge and is quite effective, but you should probably have just engaged with Charge. If there’s just one enemy, this combo is quite good but when there are multiple enemies, you can’t follow up on the Slam quite as effectively.

### Demolish

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

I’m mixed on Demolish, but by the time you can get it you’re probably not needing the 100% daze chance because you’re either already near permanently stunning everything or you have Precision Nanon Fingers and already have a 150% chance to daze anyways. The fact that you need Slam to get it as well means you need to spend the skill points on Slam which is only arguably worth it to begin with, and having no cooldown on Slam is pretty tough to make full use out of since Demolish only lasts 5 turns and the whole point of Slam is that you push away the enemy. Can it be good? Yea, it can. Is it really a vital part of a Cudgel build? Not at all.

## Customs and Folklore

### Tactful

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Villagers of Ezra (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

While you shouldn’t really ever purchase this with skill points, it’s always worth the pickup from Ezra since you reliably get 200 rep by water ritualing the mayor tree and the warden robot. With no other reason to get Ezra rep, this is just a helpful boost that can potentially get you that extra bump to get past reputation thresholds. Again, don’t get it with skill points, but always get it for rep.

### Trash Divining

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Pariahs (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

Another one you’ll probably only want to get through reputation rather than buy with skill points. As long as you’re crawling around the world and at least investigating points of interest when prompted, you usually have no shortage of secrets to share. You can learn some pretty obscure secrets and sometimes some pretty useful stuff, but it’s all RNG so you may just get nothing but 300 goatfolk villages. It’s pretty easy to get Pariah rep, especially because the Hindren Pariah at the Stilt can be water ritualed.

## Multiweapon Fighting

### Flurry/Multiweapon Proficiency

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Hindren of Bey Lah - Eskhind (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

In order to be taught these skills, you need to ensure Eskhind becomes the Hindriarch which is not even a guarantee in every playthrough. If the stars align for you and you for some reason don’t have Flurry/Multiweapon Proficiency yet, then it’s worth the rep.

Flurry makes a strike with every limb, which is actually quite good to guarantee the hits and combines well with Jab if you have Short Blades in your offhand (which you should). Multiweapon Proficiency brings our offhand strike chance from 15% to 35%; a considerable increase but still not that great. While Multiweapon Fighting, you should almost always have an offhand Short Blade with Jab; anything else and you’re missing out on DPS. One handy thing about Flurry is that it does have an Agility prerequisite, meaning its cooldown can be nullified with Triple-jointed.

Something to note is that all Multiweapon Fighting skills affect natural arms, mutated arms (including those from Multiple Arms), _and_ robotic arms (from helping hands). They **do not** affect special limbs that have natural weaponry like the head with the Horns mutation or Stinger. Something to keep in mind about robotic arms during my analysis of these skills is that they do not benefit from Jab, only from these Multiweapon Fighting skills.

Before the introduction of Single Weapon Fighting, this tree was the clear best choice in terms of damage. Now, without the proper build to utilize this tree correctly, you're better off with Single Weapon Fighting. However, if you do decide to build around this tree from character creation, you can create a whirlwind of blades for devastating effect. You'll just have to have this in mind from the start to do it properly.

### Multiweapon Expertise

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Vines (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Multiweapon Expertise brings us up to a 50% offhand strike chance. Combine this with elemental mods on each weapon and we already have a very powerful build. If you still are using a non-Short Blade in your offhand, stop immediately. Swap to a Short Blade, it’s just miles better.

### Multiweapon Mastery

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

If you’re lucky enough to find this being taught by a random village, this is one of the most expensive skill in the game to get and it confers all of its benefits even if you get it without any of its prerequisites so it’s very worth it. Multiweapon Mastery brings our offhand strike chance to 65%. We've made it all the way to the end here, but to get the most out of this tree we want to staple as many limbs and Short Blades as possible to our body. Pop in those girshling dentures, strap a wristblade to all 4 of your arms (you picked Multiple Arms, didn't you?) and just go to town. Bonus points if you have Double Muscled for the stun chance.

## Endurance

### Shake It Off

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Shake It Off is not a skill you’ll notice particularly often in terms of the “shake off” effect. Only very powerful characters ever get to 30 Toughness, so your chances of shaking off the effect are almost always going to be under 20%. That’s still nothing to sneeze at and can definitely save you, but for most of the game you’re going to be looking at a much more modest 10-15% chance. The other effect of this skill is the more important one early and that is the 25% less poison damage and duration effect. This is often a very early skill I take since the sting of a Scorpiok cannot miss and can easily destroy a lower level character. This skill greatly increases your chance of survival after taking a sting.

### Swimming

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Fish (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

Very, very few enemies have this skill, so not having it simply puts you on par with other enemies that happen to find themselves in deep liquid. You should just avoid deep liquid in general and most of the map doesn’t even have deep liquid to begin with; even less places have unavoidable deep liquid. I’ve always found other, more appealing options to take than this one, but if you have the Fish reputation this skill is just a straight upgrade whenever you find yourself in deep liquid so you might as well, especially because Fish reputation is great to have.

### Poison Tolerance

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

If you’re particularly worried about Slog and Scorpioks, then taking this skill is fine to do early. The issue with this skill is that it’s 100 skill points for a damage type that is just extremely rare and becomes even rarer post Golgotha. Something to note is that despite looking very similar, poison gas and corrosive gas are different with corrosive gas being more prevalent, more dangerous, and most importantly of all not poison. Take this skill if you’re still uncomfortable around Golgotha otherwise you can skip.

### Weathered

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Weathered is a must-have skill as sources of fire and cold damage are everywhere and just taking 15% less damage from that is an easy win. With rank 16 Carapace, you can actually be fully immune to cold and fire damage and swim around in lava for fun. This skill is single-handedly enough for you to have a comfortable amount of cold resistance for Bethesda Susa and can be made even better with many sources of cold or fire resistance early like albino ape gear for cold resistance or Issachari gear for fire resistance.

### Juicer

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

I’m admittedly biased here, but I’m not a huge user of tonics in general. Being able to ingest 2 has rarely ever been something I have wanted to do but if you play a style where everything revolves around constantly injecting tonics that you craft or something like that then I can see this being a little more useful. Some powerful combinations are skulk + hulk honey, hulk honey + salve, blaze + hulk honey, blaze + salve and salve + skulk. Get other skills first and maybe take another look at this one if you’re a menace for those tonics.

### Calloused

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This is another must-have skill. Get this always right as soon as you have 23 Toughness as there’s literally no reason not to. 1 AV with no DV penalty just makes you take less damage on average from everything that hits you. This skill and Weathered are the whole reason to go into the Endurance tree.

### Longstrider

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 250

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

I usually find that I can Sprint for longer than I need to with nothing boosting my Sprint efficiency. There has never been a moment where I thought to myself “If only Sprint didn’t run out so soon”. Sprint being on cooldown has certainly been an issue, but never it not lasting long enough. For 250 skill points we can get better skills that result in us not needing to Sprint at all, and certainly as the game goes on you will find yourself using Sprint less and less. By the time you even have the stats to get this, you probably won’t need it (even more so because if you have 25 Toughness, you’re already beefy).

## Heavy Weapon

### Strapping Shoulders

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

If you are using Heavy Weapons, this skill is an obvious take if you value your sanity. Actually, even if you are not using Heavy Weapons or not using them often this is still a pretty decent take. This doesn’t just reduce their weight for equipped Heavy Weapons, but also for Heavy Weapons just sitting in your inventory. Not only will it reduce the weight of the weapon, but it will also reduce the weight of everything in the weapon as well (even the oil in flamethrowers). It’s 100 skill points to make Heavy Weapons more worth their weight in value so if you tend to pick up Heavy Weapons often or are tired of that backup flamethrower weighing you down, give this a pickup.

### Tank

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Again assuming you are actually using Heavy Weapons, this is a great skill to have. Lower movement speed is perhaps the most crippling thing about Heavy Weapons and getting rid of that is fantastic. Not worth it if you are the Heavy Weapon dabbler, but if you have one constantly equipped make sure to get this skill.

### Sweep

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

It’s a steep cost for a skill that’s just not that great on the high-tier Heavy Weapons. In fact, on the explosive ones it’s incredibly dangerous to use since you’ve got a decent chance to just blow yourself up. It requires you to expend ammo for each shot you make, so while you’re definitely putting ordinance downrange you’re probably better off just shooting normally and controlling where those shots end up; especially since most Heavy Weapon shots come at a premium.

## Long Blade

### Long Blade Proficiency

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Long Blades are a class of weapon that has a considerable amount of complexity surrounding it. The secret to understanding these weapons is to understand the stances, which we start with two: Aggressive Stance and Defensive Stance. Switching between stances is free, we can do it as many times as we want meaning we may always attack with the stance we want. The tradeoff is that we also have to defend with the same stance as we attack with. Something key to understand is that Long Blades do not get the free +2 to hit like other weapons, so they particularly benefit from having good Agility. Let’s break down each stance.

Defensive Stance should be the stance you primarily stay in; your de facto stance. This stance is what makes Long Blades easily the best weapon for non-melee combatants as you can have any Long Blade equipped and benefit while other classes of weapons only benefit you while you’re actively attacking with them. This is also a powerful stance to increase your durability as having bonus DV means you can invest more into AV in the rare event that you do get hit if your build revolves primarily around DV.

Aggressive Stance is a unique tradeoff, as against enemies with poor DV you can deal more damage than other weapons with your attacks. Against enemies with good or decent DV, Long Blades suffer quite a bit in comparison to other weapons and this issue is exacerbated even more against enemies like goatfolk with decent DV and AV. Of course, in order for any of this to be useful, you have to have the game knowledge and understand what stats enemies have or use things like scanning to be able to read that information in-game. Stances apply to offhand Short Blades as well, and since Short Blades get a +1 to hit from skills, this stance can make Multiweapon Fighting builds even more lethal as Short Blades have less penalty and with Multiweapon Fighting skills can reap even more from the benefit.

Most of the time, you’ll end up using Defensive Stance as Aggressive Stance is quite situational and requires much more game knowledge to utilize in those proper situations.

### Lunge

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Lunge is a costly skill and oftentimes I end up not taking it in order to hit other skills instead, but it’s got a low cooldown and some pretty decent effects that synergize with multiple play styles depending on the stance. Something to note is that with every Lunge you will also attack and apply venom with a Stinger if you have one and hit with it.

While in Aggressive Stance, Lunge will move through a single tile between you and the enemy and make a strike at the enemy. This strike is at +2 penetration on top of your existing +1 penetration from Aggressive Stance. This makes this a very powerful opener if you land it. You can combine this with Juke to get a second Lunge in the middle of combat or to open yourself up to Lunge if you happen to find yourself suddenly in melee. Since this takes you through only 1 square, it tends to be less useful than Charge but is a handy alternative especially since you have extra penetration from Lunge.

While in Defensive Stance, Lunge will make an attack and then move you back 2 tiles. The enemy will of course likely just walk towards you on their next turn but this is a great skill in combination with ranged builds which makes Long Blades and sitting in Defensive Stance even more appealing as you can back up for some free shots. This skill works particularly well with confusing or paralyzing venom and Charge as you can Lunge, apply your venom, and then Charge back in for a rapid series of attacks since the venom will prevent the enemy from moving closer. It also works in a similar way with high amounts of quickness as the enemy will be too slow to close the gap before you Charge back in.

While in Dueling Stance, Lunge is guaranteed to hit and penetrate at least once, and in addition to all that will have a +1 penetration. This makes this particular version of Lunge the one you’ll want to use if Lunge comes off cooldown in the middle of combat or if you need to secure a kill or bypass heavy amounts of AV or DV. In addition to that, since Lunge has an Agility prerequisite our cooldown can be potentially nullified by Triple-jointed in which case we can use this repeatedly. We can also use this to get extra chances on applying our venom with Stinger since if the enemy resists the poison from our Lunge, we can then use Sting to try again.

### Dueling Stance

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Dueling Stance alone just gives the +2 to hit that most other weapons enjoy passively. While in isolation this isn’t that great and not worth the 200 skill points, it’s how Dueling Stance interacts with the activated Long Blade skills (particularly Swipe) that make it a worthwhile pickup. If you don’t have those skills, don’t get Dueling Stance but if you do have them, make sure not to skip this one.

### Swipe

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

In Aggressive Stance, you make an attack against everything in melee with you except allies, which means you attack all enemies and walls/furniture around you. Now, if you’re hitting more than 1 enemy with this you have more important problems to worry about than trying to hit them with a single attack. If you’re not hitting more than 1 enemy with this, it’s occasionally even worse than just bump attacking them since you have no chance of attacking with your offhand. Don’t use this with Aggressive Stance.

In Defensive Stance, you push all creatures in melee with you back 1 space and try to trip the enemies. This synergizes extremely well with Lunge in Aggressive Stance and can be used to give yourself some space for ranged attacks or for positioning adjustments. Another great defensive tool for ranged builds.

In Dueling Stance, you have the crown jewel of Long Blade effects: a highly effective disarm. This rarely fails even against powerful enemies and for many creatures that use weapons, being disarmed can completely neuter them. Enemies will not try to pick up their disarmed weapon, and will instead just scratch at you with their fists or other natural weapons they may have. This is also extraordinarily effective against turrets as it not only renders them completely useless, it also gives you access to their weapon which is guaranteed to be jacked. This synergizes extraordinarily well with true kin with a biodynamic power plant or mutants with Electrical Generation. It also allows you to get your weapon back if you use the Deploy Turret skill, which can allow you to plant down strong ranged weapons and then get them back at the end of combat. In case all that wasn’t enough, turret weapons are incredibly expensive and a fantastic source of bits, so disassembling or selling the guns and cells can give massive amounts of wealth to quickly purchase stronger weapons and armor.

### Improved Dueling Stance

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Bumps our +2 to a +3. This is a snoozer since we’re probably only using Dueling Stance for the turns we use Lunge or Swipe and then immediately switching back to Defensive Stance or Aggressive Stance.

### Improved Defensive Stance

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

+1 DV is worth practically any cost listed, so 100 skill points is chump change for such a boost. Only applies when in Defensive Stance, sure, but if you’re using Long Blades you should be in Defensive Stance most of the time.

### Improved Aggressive Stance

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

We get +1 PV at the cost of -1 to hit, which by mid game or late game is very worth it with specifically vibro weapons; Improved Aggressive Stance goes nuts with vibro weapons which we’re fairly likely to have by the time we pick this skill up. Vibro weapons are the key to unlocking the full potential of Long Blades as a backup weapon to ranged builds or even as a main build with low Strength. They’re also one of the only ways of killing powerful endgame enemies with unbelievable amounts of AV, and the PV bonus of Aggressive Stance is added after the PV of the vibro weapon is set to the enemies AV meaning our PV will always be 2 higher than the enemies’ AV. If you have terrible Agility however, don’t pick this up though since you’ll just never hit anything with it.

### En Garde!

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Sometimes

</div>

The attribute prerequisites are pretty high, so you won’t even be capable of getting this until late. 10 rounds is quite a long time to be able to spam Lunge and Swipe, but there’s a small issue. You don’t really want to spam Swipe unless you are for some reason fighting multiple enemies with weapons and need to disarm them all right now. That means that you’re left with just being able to really spam Lunge. Don’t get me wrong, 10 turns of Lunge can be pretty good but 300 skill points for that is a pretty steep investment. If you didn’t get Lunge or don’t plan on using Lunge for most of the game, then give this skill a pass. If you are an avid Lunge user, then this is a great skill for you, especially if you have a Stinger.

## Persuasion

### Menacing Stare

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Flowers (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Sometimes

</div>

Let’s be clear here, is there never a reason to take this skill? No, this can be a perfectly usable skill and even be pretty clutch in some tight moments. The problem here is that it has a 17 Ego prerequisite and has a chance to fail which means that unless you are building Ego specifically, you will be hard pressed to get much if any use out of this skill. While this is great news for Espers, for everyone else you’ll be better off with other skills. For Espers and anyone with the Ego to actually make use of this skill, you can use it to create distance between you and scary enemies as well as interrupt Sunder Mind from a distance. If you have a ton of Flower reputation this can be a somewhat good pickup if you have the stats, but that’s not likely and you really want 250 Flower rep to make Tongue Tyrants neutral to you by endgame.

### Intimidate

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Fellowship of Wardens: Warden Indrix only (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

In the rare scenario you find yourself surrounded, this can be effective. But the melee range and the long cooldown make this a steep cost for 200 skill points, especially because only Ego builds can make use of it. Even then, if you’re an Ego build you probably don’t want to be anywhere near enemies and should have many other, better ways of getting away or keeping yourself away from enemies.

### Berate

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** Hermits (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

The great thing about this skill is it always works and has a pretty long duration, 6-36 rounds. It also has a decent range of 8 tiles and is a guaranteed way of breaking Sunder Mind. It also won’t make the target try to kill you, so it naturally synergizes with Proselytize to get neutral creatures as followers (Domination and Beguiling will still anger the creature, so use at your own risk). The bad thing about this skill is that you have to get Menacing Stare first, so it’s usually not worth it in total to take this skill because the cost is a bit higher than displayed. However, if you already have Menacing Stare then this is actually a pretty good pickup. If you manage to find legendary Hermits, this is also a good pickup to get from them.

### Snake Oiler

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** Consortium of Phyta (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

This skill is incredible because it will essentially nullify the downside of a low Ego build of awful trade prices. The best part of this skill is that it is obtainable by reputation with the Consortium of Phyta, of which you can always find 2 legendary members for you to learn this skill from: Asphodel and the Oddly-Hued Glowpad. You can ritual both of them, ritual one and trade 2 secrets, or ritual one with Tactful and trade 1 secret. Get this skill always, but don’t pay skill points for it since getting it through reputation is so reliable and so easy.

### Proselytize

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Mechanimists (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

This skill has a very hefty skill point cost, and since Mechanimist reputation is so easy to get, you shouldn’t really get this skill through skill points. If you like followers, then this is a must-have skill. Indeed, followers can be quite powerful and in particular this is the only way to get a Soupy Sludge as your follower which can be unbelievably deadly if fed liquids. Proselytize won’t get you just any follower though, you essentially have to both get past their mental armor and be a higher level than them or else you won’t succeed, so those with low Ego will struggle in Proselytizing anything but the very weakest in mental armor. On the bright side, you can try this as many times as you want and you will never upset an ally, unlike Beguiling.

### Inspiring Presence

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 250

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Your followers get a miniscule amount of HP (4 \* Ego mod). Even if you stack Ego and have an insane mod, it’ll probably only be around 12 which works out to 48 HP for insane end-tier god Ego. Anything less and this just gives even worse HP. If you have literally nothing else to get and you have tons of followers, then sure why not. But there are better things to get.

## Physic

### Staunch Wounds

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Cult of the Coiled Lamb (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Bleeding typically is not a big problem, but there are a couple late-game sources of bleed that are pretty nasty and last for a fairly considerable amount of time. By then, you probably have a mountain of bandages that you can run through but for 50 skill points this is not too bad. If you've got the skill points hanging around and are looking to start fighting creatures in Lake Hinnom and beyond, you'll get a bit of use out of this one.

### Nostrums

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

There are a few issues with this skill, so let's first cover what it does so we can pick it apart properly. You can instantly cure bleeding, poison, illness and the onset of diseases for anyone in your party, given that you have the resources to do so. Let's start with poison and illness.

There are extremely few sources of poison in the game. There is poison gas, which only a single creature can generate (girshworms) or comes from poison gas grenades, there is the poison stinger which only comes from scorpioks (a rare, very early game enemy) and there is the poison from Slog, the unique boss at the bottom of Golgotha. Illness is the condition that comes at the end of being poisoned. Let's be real, you're not using this skill for either of those, especially since all illness does is temporarily remove your ability to regen health.

Bleeding can be cured here, but unfortunately you must already have Staunch Wounds to get this skill. If you have Staunch Wounds, you don't need to treat bleeding at a campfire. You can just use one of your hundreds of bandages to do so. If you're at a campfire, it means you're out of danger and also means you can probably just let the bleed heal naturally as well.

The last thing that can be cured is the onset of disease; and note that this is not the full disease itself, this is just the onset of the disease (think sore throat for Glotrot). You will still need the Corpus Choliys (or a cheesy meal that cures negative conditions on a trigger) in order to cure the full-blown disease. The problem with this is that really the only time you're likely to have a chance of getting a disease is during Golgotha, at which point you are _extremely unlikely_ to have the **21 Intelligence** necessary for this skill. Even if you did, you could just as easily cure the onset disease by eating the meal in the electric ovens of Grit Gate and munching on some raw yuckwheat. This gives you a massive bonus to saves that is plenty to rid yourself of the onset of the disease.

By the time you have the Intelligence necessary for this skill, you're likely already past Golgotha and have access to regeneration tanks if you're _really_ concerned about whatever disease is onset. This is one of those skills that _looks_ appetizing, but in reality has quite a few flaws that hinder its practical usage.

### Amputate Limb

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Does what it says on the tin, chop off a part for you or your friends. There are exactly three reasons to use this skill, none of them great:

1. You have a companion infected with a fungal infection and you do not have Domination or the Clever Girl mod; and this fungal infection annoys you enough to want to cure it.
2. Chop off your face and wear it for an Ego bonus (and the achievement I guess).
3. Chop off a limb to use as an atzmus for the Golem.

If you really want to wear your face and have the **23 Intelligence** required for this, go ahead I guess.

### Apothecary

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

This causes salve and ubernostrum injectors to last one more round, which means it gives one extra tick of healing. It's 100 skill points for about 20 extra HP per salve. This is technically enough to save you, but by the time you have the staggering **25 Intelligence** for this skill, you're probably swimming in salves (if you ever get there). Just pop another one.

## Pistol

### Steady Hand

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Extra accuracy, which works out to be quite important on Pistols because of their inferior accuracy in comparison to rifles. If you’re using Pistols, gotta start here.

### Akimbo

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** Mysterious Strangers (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

I’ll be honest, the only legendary Mysterious Stranger I’ve ever found is a legendary Star Kraken so I put not worth it for the rep just because by the time you find that you should long have Akimbo. Akimbo doesn’t just shoot both of your Pistols whenever you shoot, it shoots all of your guns whenever you shoot. That’s right, if you happen to have more than just 1 gun of any kind, Akimbo will fire all of them every time you shoot. This means if you have Gun Rack or Giant Hands or have magnetized guns, Akimbo will shoot all those suckers at once making it a worthwhile pickup even if you’re not using Pistols. It’s just a straight up DPS increase, very worth it.

### Weak Spotter

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Higher crit chance for 150 skill points? This is an obvious pick, great skill for Pistol users, not much else to say.

### Sling and Run

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

I mean you’re probably not using Sprint much and if you are, you’re probably not firing your Pistols. But, it’s 50 skill points so if you’ve got tastier skills and don’t have much to buy then why not; it’s cheap enough that in the niche use case you’ll use it, it’ll come in handy.

### Disarming Shot

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

The disarm here isn’t as reliable as the disarm from Long Blades, but with high Agility and many shots you can disarm pretty often. The only difference here is that you’ll kill your target more often before you disarm them with Pistols, but that’s rarely a problem except for the case of turrets where you want their weapons. It’s passive and can easily save you, and if you combine this with Akimbo chain pistols, you’ll actually very reliably disarm enemies. Fantastic skill.

### Dead Shot

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

We already have a skill to increase our crit hit chance, and now we can double the PV bonus from critting? No brainer; a straight upgrade that benefits even more from the masterwork mod.

### Empty the Clips

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

If you’re heavily relying on your Pistols in order to deal damage, this is an incredible skill to get. For 20 turns, you essentially double your DPS and this is more pronounced on energy weapons since you never have to reload and gets even better with enhanced quickness. You’ll need to stay still to get the full benefit, but enemies will just melt from your damage here. If you aren’t heavily invested in Pistols and only use them as a backup, you may want to skip this one since the skill point cost is quite high.

### Fastest Gun in the Rust

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 400

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

The cost of this one is steep, and I mean steep. This is the most expensive skill in the game and it has a 29 Agility prerequisite. If you can afford it though, this is a fantastic skill to take as it just gives you a permanent increase of DPS by 25%. Again, if Pistols are more of a seldom used backup, then it may not be worth taking. If you do use Pistols, this is your crown jewel.

## Self-Discipline

### Meditate

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** Seekers of the Sightless Way (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This one is unusual because it’s not that it does something that is particularly useful or game-changing, it just preserves my sanity. I always take this as soon as I get a good amount of HP (150+ or so) just because regenerating from combat takes drastically less time with Meditate. It’s passive so your character will just automatically Meditate while resting. If you haven’t tried this skill, try it. Resting feels so much better with it. If you somehow have the rep to get this, then pick it up; it doesn't hurt.

### Fasting Way

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

It’s 50 skill points, why not? You’ll use less water and your metabolizing effects will last longer. Don’t take it before you get your build up and running, but otherwise it’s convenient. If you use the Amphibious defect, then this is a good offset to that as well.

### Lionheart

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Never

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Basically the only thing that will ever actually fear you are dreadroot. Unless you are worried about plants that never move and die in 1 hit to literally anything, don’t take this.

### Iron Mind

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Robots (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

Very few things in the game confuse you, so unless you are an Esper with high amounts of glimmer this will rarely be used. The Seekers that use this are very rarely found anyways, so essentially your only real source of Confusion are Enigma Snails and Esper hunters. The chance to shake it off isn’t great either, so unless you’ve got points burning a hole in your inventory there’s no point in this one.

### Conatus

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

If you’re really interested in increasing your Sprint duration, this is the one to take over Longstrider. However, for the same reasons as Longstrider isn’t worth it, this is also not worth it.

### Mind Over Body

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Fasting Way is already enough in case you’re being bothered by eating often, this takes that to the extreme. Again if you’ve got nothing to spend points on, this can be convenient but 150 skill points is not negligible and you can definitely get better skills for that cost.

## Shield

### Block

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Fellowship of Wardens: Wardens Esther or Warden Une only (Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Again, like all equipment skills I am rating these assuming you are playing a build that utilizes them. Let’s take this time to explain Shield mechanics, since they are not simple or obvious.

Baseline, you have a 25% chance to block an attack if you are wielding a Shield in any hand. An equipped Shield will constantly apply the DV penalty (if it has one), but only apply its AV benefit on a successful block. If you have multiple Shields equipped, the DV penalty will apply for each Shield. When a creature makes an attack on its turn, the chance to block is rolled once. If the block was successful, you gain an AV bonus for that attack only equal to the highest AV bonus of all your equipped Shields. That Shield can then no longer block any other attack that creature makes this turn. If the block was unsuccessful, then you gain no Shield benefit for that attack. This process repeats for every subsequent attack made by that creature on this turn.

This means that since many enemies only attack with one limb (or only with an occasional offhand strike), wearing multiple Shields usually isn't worth it since we incur the negatives of the Shield at all times. Now that we know Shield mechanics, Block increases our block chance to 50%; not much more to say just makes your Shields more effective.

### Shield Slam

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This skill is very powerful, and especially so if you have high Strength and a powerful Shield. The attack can be resisted in which case it doesn’t do anything, but if it’s not resisted then it will do guaranteed damage that bypasses DV and AV and will knock the enemy prone which will mean their counterattack is negated for that turn since they’ll have to spend it standing up. With decent Strength, this attack will rarely be resisted so you have a very reliable attack in Shield Slam. Not only do you get the activated attack, but you will also always Shield Slam when Charging which makes your engagements even more deadly. You can also improve your Shield Slam damage by modding your Shield to be spiked.

### Swift Blocking

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Since we’ve already established that enemies will rarely attack more than once, there’s no rush to pick this skill up, especially at the cost. However, just because enemies rarely attack more than once doesn’t mean they never attack more than once, so this is still a very worthwhile pickup since it’ll give you the benefit of wielding multiple Shields without actually having to wield multiple Shields.

### Deft Blocking

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

We now have a 75% chance to block, this is an easy take. A Shield can’t benefit you if it doesn’t block so we want to boost this at every opportunity.

### Staggering Block

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

This skill is by no means reliable in any way. With very high Strength, it can become somewhat common but will never be anything but a little sugar on top. A stun for 1-2 rounds is a little low for how uncommon it is to get the stun since you not only have to roll the % chance, but you also have to have blocked the attack in the first place which we can have a maximum 75% chance to do (without relics). Can this skill save you? Absolutely. But there’s certainly better, more reliable ways to save yourself or get advantages for the cost.

### Shield Wall

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Shield Wall is like other stance skills, it has zero activation cost. Unlike other stance skills, it has much more attainable costs and the benefits are equally huge. Unfortunately, it does only last 3 turns which isn’t much, but can be the difference between life and death if you get yourself caught with enemies on all sides since it literally does block every attack for those 3 turns, regardless of your other Shield skills and regardless of just how many attacks are made against you. You could have 9 Oboroquoru using Flurry for a total of 54 attacks in one turn, Shield Wall will block them all. Note that blocking means that you get the benefit of your Shield; which for the non-bucklers that you can use this with means you get a significant increase but doesn’t make you invincible.

The real thing that puts this stance over others despite its short duration is that it also has a fairly short cooldown as well; meaning that at high Willpower you can essentially just spam this for massive AV benefit. While high AV won’t make you invincible to everything, it will make you exceptionally difficult to kill for the vast majority of creatures.

## Short Blades

### Short Blade Expertise

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

The +1 to hit is marginal here, but because it makes our main hand Short Blade attacks be 25% faster, this actually starts to make Short Blades look attractive to high quickness builds. Typically though, the real reason to use Short Blades is for offhand attacks with Jab. Dual Short Blade builds are essentially mandatory if you’re planning on using Short Blades in your main hand just because Short Blades have very few effects that require being wielding in your primary hand to be effective, so why not equip a more powerful weapon and get its benefits as well? Aside from this skill, if you’re going for offhand Short Blades, you’ll really just want Jab and maybe Bloodletter and Rejoinder.

### Jab

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Jab got a sneaky nerf that seems to have largely flown under the radar, but it went from doubling your offhand Short Blade strike chance to making it so that when you strike with your offhand Short Blade, you strike with it twice. While this may seem like the same thing on first glance, it's not. Instead of ensuring you reliably attack with all your offhand Short Blades (by raising your hit chance above 100%), you are now vulnerable to probability bringing you into a damage lull when you _really need that damage_. Of course, it just as likely has the chance to give you more damage than possible with the old version of Jab and over a long enough period of time, it will _almost_ be just as good.

The other part of the nerf is that bringing your hit chance above 100% will occasionally allow a second attack in addition the guaranteed attack. Since you cannot get an offhand strike chance above 100% now, you cannot benefit from this property of offhand strikes anymore and thus the damage is marginally worse in the aggregate.

Jab is still extremely good, but even though it's not the silver bullet it used to be it definitely still makes Short Blades the best choice when it comes to offhand attacks. If you're not investing in Multiweapon Fighting then of course it won't be any good for you, but if you are then this skill is a must-have.

Something to note is that Jab does _not_ affect robotic arms from helping hands, so if you are using helping hands making the swap to Short Blades is actually not worth it for Multiweapon Fighting purposes.

### Bloodletter

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This makes your Short Blade attacks do just a bit more damage. It eventually synergizes well with Shank, so it will become important for full Short Blade builds. Free damage is always nice though, and while Bloodletter doesn’t give you that significant of an increase, you can stack this quite quickly with multiple Short Blades and high offhand attack chance.

### Hobble

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

A hobbled enemy is quite easy to get away from and this will give you a guaranteed penetration on hit. The problem with this skill is you can only use it with a Short Blade in your primary hand, which most builds that use Short Blades will use it as an offhand. If you happen to use Short Blades in your main hand, then this is a good skill. If you don’t, then you can give this an easy pass.

### Pointed Circle

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Sometimes

</div>

I’m giving this a really big caveat: If you specifically are stacking Triple-jointed and are using main hand Short Blades, then you can actually do some pretty nasty damage for free if you get lucky with your procs since Juke has an Agility prerequisite. If you don’t, then in order to get any use out of this skill you have to Juke into the enemy which you usually specifically don’t want to do unless you’ve found yourself way out of position and an enemy is blocking you. There are many common scenarios where you really, really do not want to swap places with the enemy because it will just be way worse for you. Using Juke offensively also means that you cannot use it defensively for the duration of its cooldown, which can be risky. All in all, there are definitely some silly builds where you can stack this a crazy amount but usually this is not worth it.

### Rejoinder

If you have high DV, then this is just a no-brainer take as it’ll give you a straight upgrade to your DPS. This can be used regardless of how many times you’re attacked at once, so the increase can be quite significant and potentially even allow you to kill weaker support enemies while you focus on a bigger threat. If you have terrible DV then this won’t do anything for you, but otherwise is a great addition.

### Shank

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 250

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

While this seems like just free damage from an activated ability, in Multiweapon Fighting builds this is typically not worth it since you only get a single attack instead of your multiple attacks from your multiple equipped weapons. If you can get multiple bleeds stacked on your target, this can potentially hit for massive damage. While you probably won’t be using this to punch through crazy AV, it can be used to nuke high HP targets especially if you have ways of applying status effects outside of bleed and have a powerful Short Blade. Triple-jointed builds can also make use of the Agility prerequisite to potentially spam this attack.

## Single Weapon Fighting

### Opportune Attacks

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

The way this tree is designed is you either take it or you take Multiweapon Fighting (or neither, if you hate yourself I guess). If you are a truekin or a mutant without the Multiple Arms mutation, you should be taking this tree. Even if you do have Multiple Arms, you'd probably be best with this tree, but at least now there's more of an argument for Multiweapon Fighting. I'm not doing a lot of talking about this skill in particular because it's pretty mid, but necessary for the rest of the tree. Let's switch gears and discuss the actual skill.

You're very likely to get this skill very early on because you just have to for the actually good skills, and when you get it you'll probably not notice its impact at all. Critical hits are uncommon enough that refreshing weapon or shield cooldowns won't do a whole lot (and you probably don't have many to begin with). However, in the mid-late game this skill goes absolutely insane with long cooldown stance skills like En Garde! and Berserk!, especially because by then you're likely to have Weapon Expertise or Weapon Mastery and you're striking more often meaning more crits or have masterwork gear/precision nanon fingers to boost your crit chances further. It becomes fairly likely for you to crit and then refresh those powerful, long cooldowns and go on an absolute tear, so don't forget you have this as you gain those powerful cooldown skills!

### Weapon Expertise

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

50% chance to strike again, but the crazy thing about this chance is that it can proc from _any_ attack while you're single-weapon fighting. This _includes_ the extra attack from Backswing, meaning cudgels can get a large amount of attacks while still benefitting from all of the powerful Single Weapon Fighting skills. There's not much more to say; it's a powerful passive, if you're not Multiweapon Fighting then get this skill.

### Penetrating Strikes

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

And here it is, the whole reason you take this skill tree. The way this works is that the game will roll its penetrations normally. It will then add 1 to that number. This means that if you hit, _your attack will always penetrate_. No matter the enemy AV, you will always penetrate at least once. Combine this with the naturally high PV of two-handed weapons or the extremely reliable ceremonial vibrokhopesh and you will absolutely rip through enemies. With the vibrokhopesh and this skill, you can turn any build into a melee threat, regardless of their attribute spread.

This also means it pairs extremely well with Axes, as in order to Dismember you must penetrate the enemies' AV. This means as long as you make contact with a Dismember strike, it will always Dismember. Combine this with Berserk! and Opportune Strikes and limbs will go flying. Any creature not immune to decapitation is on a serious timer with this brutal combination.

### Weapon Mastery

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

There isn't a lot to say about this skill; it's Weapon Expertise but better. Everything that applied to Weapon Expertise applies here, x2. Get it.

## Tactics

### Hurdle

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

You’ll probably not see the value in this very often, but it’s common enough to want to Sprint to either close the gap on a ranged enemy or to escape from a ranged enemy so having a better chance of dodging those attacks is quite useful. This is especially useful early on in combating slugsnouts since you’ll absolutely want to get away or close the gap on them as fast as possible because of their high damage. Aside from these, you’ll have to get this one in order to get better skills in the tree so this is an easy early take.

If you happen to not have Sprint (like through permanent Domination), you can gain that ability when you buy this skill.

### Deft Throwing

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Most of my runs will just ignore this one since I don’t throw things very often in general. That’s not to say this is a bad skill because for what it does it’s actually quite good. It’s just that throwing things and more so being accurate with what you throw is rarely that important. If your playstyle revolves heavily on crafting and throwing grenades, then by all means take this skill, you’ll see great return. Otherwise, it’s just not necessary.

### Charge

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 150

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This is my favorite skill in the game, and arguably also the best skill in the game. It has so many applications and so many synergies that it’s really hard to overvalue it. Charge actually has quite a few mechanics around it, so let’s first cover what it does.

When you use Charge, you need to select a target 2-3 tiles away from you. Any target within 1 tile is too close. After selecting your target, you’ll make an attack on the first wall or creature you hit on the way to that target. You’ll then make an attack and if you hit, your attack has +1 PV on it. If you are in melee with a hostile enemy, you will be unable to use Charge.

The first thing to add to the mix is what constitutes a target. A target can be anything that isn’t an empty tile, which means you can even target items on the floor. You won’t attack items on the floor, so in these cases you will actually Charge beyond your target and get Stunned for one turn. You can use this fact as well as the fact that you can Charge walls to use Charge as an escape tool as well as an initiation tool. While using Charge in this way has more requirements, it gets you farther than anything else in a single turn.

The second thing to add to the mix is that Axes, Cudgels and Shields have a dedicated skill that just improves your Charge strikes. Those were covered already in their own sections.

The third thing to add is that if you have a Stinger or Horns, you will automatically make strikes with them when you Charge. This means that with these mutations you can make your initiations that much more powerful to potentially kill or disable an enemy on the Charge itself.

The fourth thing to add is that you can improve your range significantly whether you’re a true kin or a mutant. Mutants can get a level based increase with Wings and true kin can use the pentaceps cybernetic. This means that both your escape and initiation range increase significantly.

The fifth thing to add is that Charge synergizes naturally with many other skills like Jump, Juke, Swipe and Slam as they all move yourself or the enemy which allow you to get another Charge in the middle of an extended combat. Charge has a low cooldown which with middling levels of Willpower can easily allow it to come off cooldown in the middle of many mid-late game fights.

All in all, there’s no reason to not get Charge in any run; even runs that you don’t fight in melee because of its escape potential.

### Kickback

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

If you use guns as your primary weapon, this is actually quite good as it’ll give you space for more shots. This used to be locked behind the Bow and Rifle tree, so now that it's in the Tactics tree it's much more valuable since you don't have to buy any Bow and Rifle skills for non-rifle builds.

### Juke

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Juke moves you in any tile you want (except for walls) for literally no opportunity cost. It doesn’t just move you fast, it moves you instantly; regardless of quickness you move in that tile right away and can act again. This makes Juke the perfect defensive tool especially when combined with skills like Jump and Charge. There are many scenarios where the difference between a great position and a compromised position is a single tile and situations where an enemy cuts off your escape route.

In addition to being a great tool for the purposes of moving that one tricky tile, it also will break the hold enemies can have on you since you can use Juke even in these scenarios. Juke also has an Agility prerequisite which makes it a prime candidate for Triple-jointed. Finally, Juke is also a prerequisite for Tumble which gives us access to +1 DV permanently, so it’s worth taking even if it wasn’t already great.

## Tinkering

### Gadget Inspector

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** Barathrumites (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

Gadget Inspector will improve your ability to identify artifacts, which is pretty handy. With it, you will quite rarely fail at inspecting artifacts even with low Intelligence and even on high complexity artifacts. Even more rarely will you break artifacts you try to identify. Deploying wiring is, as of now, rather useless but if you need to repair power links for gates then this is what you need.

There are several ways to learn artifact recipes that don’t involve data disks. The most well-known is Psychometry which anyone can get from cooking with bananas, but you can also learn recipes from Barathrumites and Daughters of Exile you can water ritual. However, you will still need the dedicated Tinker skills in order to craft the recipes that you learn. Gadget Inspector will also allow you to see what recipes are on data disks so you can begin your collection for when you get Tinker X skills.

In my experience, you should always save the skill points here and get this skill for reputation from the Barathrumites. Barathrumite rep is absurdly easy to get as you do tons of quests for them and you won’t need the benefit from this skill until about the point you can get the skill for rep from the Barathrumites.

### Disassemble

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

This is your only way of getting bits, so if you’re planning on doing literally any Tinkering you must have this skill. There’s not much more analysis required for this one because of its necessity.

### Scavenger

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

If you’re planning on doing insane amounts of Tinkering right from the start, then this skill can see some use. However, the problem is that you don’t get that many useful bits from this in the short term. Typically, there will be no shortage of artifacts that aren’t of much use or are duplicates that you can Disassemble for all the bits you really need. Again, unless you’re doing some insane levels of Tinkering like throwing grenades for literally every enemy you find, you’ll probably run into no shortage of bits. You can find some other useful stuff in the trash besides just scrap, but you’ll probably be better off putting your skill points elsewhere.

### Lay Mine/Set Bomb

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 50

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

You’ll rarely find situations where you can actually use this skill well as places you’ve already been probably won’t have any enemies in them and if you can get around a mine, the enemies can also probably get around the mine. You can combine this skill with Jump for decent effect, but it always seems to be the case that it takes far more effort than is worth it in order for this skill to actually be effective in the way you’d expect.

While mines are mostly useless, bombs are more useful since these work on a timer; meaning that if you can plan well enough you can get your enemy in the range and not catch yourself in it as well. Again, this does take more effort than is usually worth it and so suffers from the same problem as mines. You’re just going to be better off tossing the grenades right on their head. The only situation where that’s not viable is with Cherubim so in that particular niche you can see a bit more use out of bombs specifically.

### Repair

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** Daughters of Exile (Worth It)

**Worth:** No

</div>

Another skill that while definitely has its uses is far better off being purchased for rep instead of skill points. Keep the skill points for combat effectiveness and such, by the time you need this skill you can buy it from Yla Haj in Ezra. This skill will repair both broken and rusted items, so it’s definitely worth the pickup at some point just in case.

### Deploy Turret

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Sometimes

</div>

Deploy Turret is an interesting skill because it has a lot of potential, but needs a considerable amount of setup and support. If you have high Strength (to carry weapons/ammo/cells) and the Long Blades disarm (to get those guns back), this can be quite strong with the right setup. The downside is it leads to an (in my opinion) very boring playstyle where you secure a location, set up your killbox and then lure in enemies to be obliterated by your turrets. You can also use flamethrower/freeze ray turrets in order to disable your opponents. If you don’t mind playing extremely slow and have the right setup for this skill, it can be pretty good. If you’re not planning on playing around this skill, then you probably will find little to no use from it.

### Tinker I

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early-Mid Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Tinker I is conveniently for us the best of the 3 Tinker X skills. With it, we get access to learn recipes through data disks and with it the majority of tinkerable items. Mind you, most of those items aren’t that great but Tinker I really isn’t about the artifacts, it’s about the mods. The vast majority of useful mods can be found in Tinker I and since the cost to get this is so cheap and the power of mods you can get so high, Tinker I is always useful no matter what build or style you’re playing.

### Tinker II

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 200

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Tinker II is very notable for the powerful artifacts you’re able to craft with it. In particular, the geomagnetic disc, portable wall and high powered magnet are all very useful items to be able to build, and while the mods aren’t quite as spectacular as those in Tinker I, with certain builds mods like jacked and overloaded are great and radio-powered is always a fantastic mod to get. In particular, I really want to have this skill by A Call To Arms in order to build the portable walls that I need. While this skill doesn’t have quite the magnitude of Tinker I, the prerequisites are low enough and the benefits high enough that this is an easy pickup.

### Reverse Engineer

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

Reverse Engineer has two effects:

1. You have a 75% chance to learn to build an artifact upon disassembling it.
2. You have a 25% chance to learn a mod on an artifact upon disassembling it.

It's that second one that makes the difference here. 25 Intelligence is a fairly steep cost to pay, but you're quite likely to find all kinds of artifacts that you don't want anyway with a huge variety of mods. It can be endlessly frustrating to try and find the ones you want from just merchants, especially if you spawn a world with a low amount of schematics drafters in the Stilt. Learning how to make an artifact is generally not helpful as artifacts you want to make in bulk you can just learn from Psychometry and artifacts you want just to have you generally only need one copy and disassembling it is a huge risk. Depending on how rare that artifact is, you may just want to use metamorphic polygel instead of risking the chance to not learn the recipe.

25% chance is pretty low, but some mods can be quite common to find on items but difficult to find on merchants. Jacked is one that comes to the front of mind. Not only are you able to get any mod you'd like, but you also have the side benefit of being able to turn bits from low-value or useless artifacts/scrap into sellable artifacts for items that you _do_ want, which is extremely valuable. This skill becomes available to most builds around the time you finish Earl of Omonporch, which is also around the time you will be purchasing extremely expensive items and will want some cash to throw around.

### Tinker III

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 300

**Obtain By:** Late Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** No

</div>

Don’t get me wrong, you can build some pretty insane gear with Tinker III and assuming you just have it somewhat early from something like a random village, you can get some powerful artifacts (assuming you have a way of buying the right scrap for bits). Unfortunately, there is a substantial cost besides the 300 skill points which is the 29 Intelligence prerequisite. Since Intelligence has an awful return on investment (at some point, you just have all the skills you need), investing the points all the way up to 29 to build these artifacts only slightly earlier than you could otherwise get them (since you still need the bits) just ends up not being worth it.

## Wayfaring

### Mind’s Compass/Make Camp

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 100

**Obtain By:** Early Game

**Faction:** N/A

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

The obvious use of this skill is to save your sanity by making overworld travel not completely awful, but this is actually highly beneficial to your survival as you won’t get lost as often in dangerous areas. While getting lost isn’t an immediate death sentence, depending on your abilities, how dangerous the area is you got lost in and the look of the map you got lost in, you can be pretty dead pretty quickly with the wrong luck. This is especially true early game, so this is a must-have as soon as you start looking to leave for Grit Gate. Make Camp comes standard on all _player_ characters, but if you've gone through permanent Domination you won’t have this. In this scenario, getting the first Wayfaring skill becomes even more important since not being able to ease your hunger whenever you want becomes seriously annoying (believe me).

### Wilderness Lore

<div class="section-info">

**Cost:** 25 (Flower Fields Lore), 50

**Obtain By:** Mid-Late Game

**Faction:** Roots (Jungle Lore) (Not Worth It)

**Worth:** Yes

</div>

These are all really cheap skills to grab and almost every single one of them is worth it. The only exceptions are Flower Field lore, Ruins lore and Salt Dune lore. These are either too easy to walk around, not dangerous, and/or don’t contain interesting locations. Jungle lore is especially good to grab just for the sheer amount of Jungle tiles on the map. The rest of the lore is super handy to find lairs in order to improve your reputation with factions like Unshelled Reptiles, Fish and Flowers as well as finding lairs with high concentrations of legendary creatures like Baboon and Goatfolk lairs. Make sure your combat build is online before grabbing these, but once you’ve got your core these are very nice to go into.
