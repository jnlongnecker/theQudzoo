# A-F-F-I-N-E's Advice

---

This is a series of articles meant to compile my understanding and strategy for Caves of Qud. It’s a wonderful game, but there’s so much to know and understand and there are not many written guides that go into what I consider an “appropriate level of detail”. There are some good beginner tutorials out there, but after a couple of hours in the game, most of us are no longer “beginners” in that sense where we struggle with the controls or understanding what we’re looking at.

These articles seek to remedy that issue by going into the aforementioned “appropriate level of detail” on every major part of the game I can think of. If you’ve ever looked for Caves of Qud tutorials and found the ones out there lacking or telling you information you already knew, this is for you. If you have literally never touched the game before or struggle to get started, I recommend you start with the [new player guide](/advice/novice). If you're interested in observing a playthrough narrated by myself oriented for beginners, you can find my [beginner friendly playthrough here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEs0PGfOMtH9XKoRUpLc6avmtBqwy662o&si=0d_0AgareY5CFjtb). While I don't go over the most basic of controls and play rather quickly at times, there is no video resource more complete on the game, especially for its (relative) brevity.

During these articles, there will be a lot of nasty things called opinions spouted all over the place. There will always be reasons behind the advice given here, but of course, these reasons could lead two different people toward two different solutions. I’ll be using my own opinion to divide the game up into more digestible chunks, analyze enemies, consider equipment, and make general judgments.

Thanks for checking this out, and happy reading!
